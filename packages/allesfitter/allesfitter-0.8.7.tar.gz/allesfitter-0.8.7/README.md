[German-ish for *everything-fitter*]

*allesfitter* (G端nther & Daylan, 2019, ascl:1903.003) is a public and user-friendly astronomy software package for modeling photometric and RV data. It can accommodate multiple exoplanets, multi-star systems, star spots, stellar flares, and various noise models. A graphical user interface allows to define all input. Then, *allesfitter* automatically runs a nested sampling or MCMC fit, and produces ascii tables, latex tables, and plots. For all this, *allesfitter* constructs an inference framework that unites the versatile packages *ellc* (light curve and RV models; Maxted 2016), *aflare* (flare model; Davenport et al. 2014), *dynesty* (static and dynamic nested sampling; Speagle 2019), *emcee* (Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling; Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) and *celerite* (Gaussian Process models; Foreman-Mackey et al. 2017).

"This work makes use of the *allesfitter* package (*G端nther \& Daylan, in prep.*), which is a convenient wrapper around the packages *ellc* (Maxted 2016), *aflare1.py* (Davenport 2014), *dynesty* (Speagle 2019), *emcee* (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) and *celerite* (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2017). This work makes further use of the *python* programming language (Rossum 1995) and the open-source *python* packages *numpy* (van der Walt, Colbert & Varoquaux 2011), *scipy* (Jones et al. 2001), *matplotlib* (Hunter 2007), *tqdm* (doi:10.5281/zenodo.1468033) and *seaborn* (https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)."
