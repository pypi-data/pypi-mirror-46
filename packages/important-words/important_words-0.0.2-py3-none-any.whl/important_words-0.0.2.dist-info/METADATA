## Introduction 
*mask-predictor* is a wrapper of BERT which can predict masked word of a sentence.

Example:

Given : I like to eat * as my dinner.

Result: [Chicken, Fish, Curry, Steak, ...]


## How to run this
All you need to do is:
1. Run `pip install mask-predictor`
2. Download `main.py` and `input.json`
3. Run `main.py`

The main.py is a simple example showing how to use the *mask-predictor* package.
The `main.py` will read the `input.json`, and will produce a output file named `result.json`.

**Note that the 1st time of running will download the [spacy model file](https://spacy.io/models/en). Please re-run the code after it has successfully downloaded. The model file sized 7xxMB and expected to take fews minutes. Please keep your computer awake while downloading, otherwise it might fails.**
