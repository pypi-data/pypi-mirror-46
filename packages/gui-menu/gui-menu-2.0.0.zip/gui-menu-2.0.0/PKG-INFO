Description: 
        # gui-menu: The Only Terminal-Based GUI Menu for Python!
        
        ## About
        
        gui-menu is a Python module that lets you put easy-to-use menus in your Python programs. It was developed by Seth Peace for SPPyOS (Seth Peace's Python OS, coming to PyPI soon).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Just run `python -m pip install gui-menu` or `py -m pip install gui-menu` (You may find only one works, or that both works. It depends on your Python setup.).
        
        ## Usage
        
        Using gui-menu is simple! Just run the following:
        
        ~~~
        
        import menu
        
        menu.menu(title="Title goes here", options=["Option 1 goes here", "Option 2 goes here", "etc."])
        
        ~~~
        
        It will return the index of the selcted option (i.e. if option 3 is selected it will return int(3)).
        ## Supported Systems
        
        This software has only been tested on a Windows 10 with Python 3.7 (not as a PyPI module, as just a file. I have no idea if the PyPI version will work.). If someone could test it on another system and e-mail me how it works, great! I'll give you credit on this page.
        ## Changelog
         - 0.2.0 - Probably fixed the fact that menu.menu didn't work. Added info to README.
         - 0.1.0 - Initial release.
