===============================
Account Invoice Import Factur-X
===============================

This module is an extension of the module *account_invoice_import* to add the ability to import ZUGFeRD 1.0 and Factur-X/ZUGFeRD 2.0 invoices. The `ZUGFeRD <http://www.pdflib.com/knowledge-base/pdfa/zugferd-invoices/>`_ standard is a standard based on `CII <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`_ (Cross-Industry Invoice) for electronic invoicing. Factur-X, also called ZUGFeRD 2.0 in Germany, is now the official e-invoicing standard in France and Germany. A Factur-X invoice is a PDF invoice with an embedded XML file that carries structured information about the invoice.
