summary: |
  Component to accumulate flow and calculate drainage area.  This is
  accomplished by first finding flow directions by a user-specified
  method and then calculating the drainage area and discharge.
  Optionally, spatially variable runoff can be set either by the
  model grid field 'water__unit_flux_in'.
