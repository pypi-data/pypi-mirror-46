m_sp:
  description: |
    m in the stream power equation (power on drainage area). Overridden
    if a_sp, b_sp, and c_sp are supplied.
  value:
    default: 0.5
    type: float
    units: ''
n_sp:
  description: |
    n in the stream power equation (power on slope). Overridden if a_sp,
    b_sp, and c_sp are supplied.
  value:
    default: 1.0
    type: float
    units: ''
sp_type:
  description: |
    Controls how the law is implemented.
  value:
    default: set_mn
    type: string
    units: ''
threshold_sp:
  description: |
    The threshold stream power, below which no erosion occurs. This threshold
    is assumed to be in "stream power" units, i.e., if sp_type is 'Shear_stress',
    the value should be tau**a.
