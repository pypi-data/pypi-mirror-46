Description: # Contres
        Contres command line interface - WIP
        
        Contres is the command line interface for deploying a research 
        project in a Gitlab environment following the CR guidelines. 
        CR is short for continuous research (like contres), an outline 
        of how to utilize gitlab CI runners to make research scripts 
        reproducible and cloneable with one click.
        
        A paper or guide will be distributed with this CLI once it left 
        experimental stage.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Please not that this tool might heavily change as it is still work in progress.
        
        Install contres using pip
        
        ```bash
        pip install contres
        ```
        
        Then, there should be a cli available on your path called `contres`. 
        
        ```bash
        contres -h
        ```
        
        This guide will be extended with the next release.
