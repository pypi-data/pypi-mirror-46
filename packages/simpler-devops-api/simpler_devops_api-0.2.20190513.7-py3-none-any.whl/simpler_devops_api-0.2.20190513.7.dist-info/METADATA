# Introduction 
A Simpler Way of Interacting with Azure Devops through Python

# Getting Started
This is a work in progress so functions are implemented as they are needed. 

Initially support is providede for getting information on projects, repositories, branches and for getting and setting branch policies.

Authentication information is provided via two methods -

##1 - via environment variables

DEVOPS_PAT : PAT for azure devops organisation that has the appropriate permissions for the org you are looking to talk to 
DEVOPS_URL : The organisation URL for the organisation that you are looking to talk to. 

##2 - via configuration file. 

If the environment variables are not set then the package will look for ```.devops.ini``` in your home directory, or ```devops.ini``` in the default user data directory (see appdirs for where this is likely to be on your OS)

### Config file format

Example config file

```
[DEFAULT]
DEVOPS_PAT = your_long_pat_token
DEVOPS_URL = https://dev.azure.com/organisation
```
