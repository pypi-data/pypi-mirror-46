        # About
        bletchley is a pure [Python](https://www.python.org/) cryptographic tool suite. It provides historical ciphers. In the future it will also provide cryptographic attacks (cryptanalysis) to use against these ciphers.
        
        If you find an bug or have a feature you'd like to see, please raise an [issue](https://gitlab.com/manny_cyber_wizard/bletchley/issues/new).

        Supported ciphers can be found on our [wiki](https://gitlab.com/manny_cyber_wizard/bletchley/wikis/home#ciphers).
        
        ## Simple Example
        Ciphers can be accessed by adding bletchley to your Python path:
        ~~~~
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/bletchley
        ~~~~
        Then importing bletchley into your Python script:
        ~~~~
        from bletchley.ciphers import CaesarCipher
        ~~~~
        And creating an instance of the cipher:
        ~~~~
        my_cipher = CaesarCipher()
        ~~~~
        From here, you can encrypt and decrypt messages using the cipher:
        ~~~~
        my_message = "Hello World!
        cipher_text = my_cipher.encrypt(my_message)
        plain_text = my_cipher.decrypt(cipher_text)
        ~~~~
        
        ## Advanced Example
        All ciphers implement the abstract class: Cipher. This means that all ciphers have encrypt and decrypt functions you can use. Note that some more complex ciphers (such as the [VIC Cipher](VIC-Cipher)) may have additional arguments when called. Where possible, these will be included with the cipher.
        
        Taking the VIC cipher as an example, another argument is needed to encrypt/decrypt messages. This is called a 'checkerboard'. We can create our cipher in the same way as we did for the Caeser cipher before:
        ~~~~
        from bletchley.ciphers import VICCipher
        my_cipher = VICCipher()
        ~~~~
        Before we can encrypt/decrypt any message, a checkerboard is needed. We now have two options:
        1.  Create our own checkerboard
        2.  Let the VIC cipher generate a random checkerboard for us
        
        For now we will choose the easier of the two, and let the VIC cipher generate a checkerboard for us:
        ~~~~
        my_checkerboard = my_cipher.generate_checkerboard()
        my_message = "Hello World!
        cipher_text = my_cipher.encrypt(my_message, checkerboard)
        plain_text = my_cipher.decrypt(cipher_text, checkerboard)
        ~~~~
        The checkerboard, in this example, could be exported and saved for future use.
