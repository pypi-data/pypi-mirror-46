## How To Install Python

### MacOS
See [this link](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/) for
instructions on installing with Brew.

### Linux
Use your native package manager

### Windows
See [this link](https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/), but I make no guarantees that Selenium will actually work as I have not tested it.


### Bugs

If it stops working or otherwise crashes, delete the latest post manually and
start it again after waiting a minute. I make no guarantees that it will work
perfectly for every profile.
