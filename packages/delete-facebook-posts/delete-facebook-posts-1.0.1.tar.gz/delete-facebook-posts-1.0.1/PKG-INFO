Description: ## How To Use
        
        * Make sure that you have Google Chrome installed and that it is up to date
        * Install python 3.x (tested on python 3.7) along with pip
        * `pip3 install --user delete-facebook-posts`
        * Run `deletefb -E "youremail@example.org" -P "yourfacebookpassword" -U "https://www.facebook.com/your.profile.url"`
        * Wait a long time
        * Say goodbye to your Facebook posts!
        
        ## How To Install Python
        
        ### MacOS
        See [this link](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/) for
        instructions on installing with Brew.
        
        ### Linux
        Use your native package manager
        
        ### Windows
        See [this link](https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/), but I make no guarantees that Selenium will actually work as I have not tested it.
        
        
        ### Bugs
        
        If it stops working or otherwise crashes, delete the latest post manually and
        start it again after waiting a minute. I make no guarantees that it will work
        perfectly for every profile.
