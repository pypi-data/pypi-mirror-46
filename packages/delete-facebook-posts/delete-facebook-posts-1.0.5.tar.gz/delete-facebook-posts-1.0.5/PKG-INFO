Description: ## Why?
        
        I needed a simple and reliable way to delete Facebook posts. There are
        third-party apps that claim to do this, but they all require handing over your
        credentials, or are unreliable in other ways. Since this uses Selenium, it is
        more reliable, as it uses your real web browser, and it is less likely Facebook
        will block or throttle you.
        
        As for why you would want to do this in the first place. That is up to you.
        Personally I wanted a way to delete most of my content on Facebook without
        deleting my account.
        
        ## Will this *really* delete posts?
        I can make no guarantees that Facebook doesn't store the data somewhere forever
        in cold storage. However this tool is intended more as a way to clean up your
        online presence and not have to worry about what you wrote from years ago.
        Personally, I did this so I would feel less attached to my Facebook profile
        (and hence feel the need to use it less).
        
        ## Installation
        You have several options to run it.
        1) Install from PyPI with `pip install --user delete-facebook-posts`
        2) Clone this repo and run `pip install --user .` or do `pip install --user
        git+https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB.git`
        3) Set up a Python virtualenv, activate it, and run `pip install -r
        requirements.txt`, then you can just run `python deletefb/deletefb.py` as you
        would if you had installed it from PyPI.
        
        ## How To Use It
        
        * Make sure that you have Google Chrome installed and that it is up to date
        * Also install the chromedriver for Selenium. See [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads). On Arch Linux you can find this in the `chromium` package, and on Ubuntu it is `chromium-chromedriver`.
        * Run `deletefb -E "youremail@example.org" -P "yourfacebookpassword" -U "https://www.facebook.com/your.profile.url"`
        * The script will log into your Facebook account, go to your profile page, and
          start deleting posts. If it cannot delete something, then it will "hide" it
          from your timeline instead.
        * Be patient as it will take a very long time, but it will eventually clear
          everything. You may safely minimize the chrome window without breaking it.
        
        ## 2FA
        * It is recommended that you disable Two-Factor Authentication tempoprarily
          while you are running the script, in order to get the best experience.
        
        * If you do have 2-Factor Auth configured then the script will pause for 20
          seconds to allow you to enter your code and log in.
        
        * You may also pass in a code by using the `-F` argument, e.g. `-F 111111`.
        
        ## Headless mode
        * The tool supports running Chrome in headless mode with the `--headless`
          option, which may be preferable if you plan on running it in the background.
        
        ## Bugs
        
        If it stops working or otherwise crashes, delete the latest post manually and
        start it again after waiting a minute. I make no guarantees that it will work
        perfectly for every profile. Please file an issue if you run into any problems.
