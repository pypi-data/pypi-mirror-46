## About

`PixivPy` is rather a powerful Pixiv API. But its responses are raw json and need
further processing before being used. And both `PublicAPI` and `AppAPI` has its pros and
cons.

This package is designed to serve as a proxy API for `PixivPy`. User can just
fetch illusts they want and doesn't need to think about trifles like paging
parameters or response's json structure.

My main motivation is to write a pixiv crawler to download images. So unrelated APIs are not implemented.
It's welcome to help me implement those APIs.

P.S. English and Chinese discussion is OK. Please forgive me for the poor
English. Fixing typo is also welcome.
