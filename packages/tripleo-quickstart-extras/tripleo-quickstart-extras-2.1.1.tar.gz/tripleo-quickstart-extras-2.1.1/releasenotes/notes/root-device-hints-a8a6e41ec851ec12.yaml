features:
  - Added the possibility to give root device hints
    for nodes, covering the same type of hints as
    Ironic allows.
deprecations:
  - Currently only support for disk size hint was possible
    on OOOQ. This was using the ``disk_root_device_size``
    setting, as well as the disk property on instackenv.json
    This feature is not being removed, but the usage of new
    root device hintes feature is prefered. If some device
    hints are given using this new env setting, the old
    way will be ignored.
    In the future, ``disk_root_device_size`` hint will need
    to be deprecated.
fixes:
  - Currently OOOQ deploys on baremetal, on servers with multiple
    disks, is not behaving correctly. There was the possibility
    of giving root device hints, but only based on size. On systems
    where the disk size was the same, it was impossible to target
    the right disk.
