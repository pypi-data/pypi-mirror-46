fixes:
  - |
    Fix `undercloud_roles_data` to contain a relative path as tripleoclient
    expects it.
other:
  - |
    ``undercloud deploy`` CLI now supports `undercloud_roles_data`.
    It can also be defined in `undercloud.conf` as `roles_file` to be
    used with ``undercloud install --use-heat`` as well.
