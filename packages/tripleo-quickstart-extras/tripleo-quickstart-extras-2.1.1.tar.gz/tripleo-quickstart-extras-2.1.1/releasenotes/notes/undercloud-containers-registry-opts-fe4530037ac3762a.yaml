    Containerized underclouds are allowed to have a custom
    `undercloud_docker_registry_tag`. `undercloud_docker_registry_port`
    may be omitted, if `undercloud_docker_registry_host` does not
    expect a custom port, like 'docker.io'.

    The docker registry host, port and tag for containerized undercloud
    services default to the values provided for overcloud deployments.
    You may want to alter it, if building images locally with Kolla, or
    fetching from remote registries not fitting overcloud deployment cases.
    As overcloud deployments may consume images form the undercloud local
    registry, it is possible to have `undercloud_docker_*` and
    `docker_*` params diverged for containerized underclouds vs overclouds.
