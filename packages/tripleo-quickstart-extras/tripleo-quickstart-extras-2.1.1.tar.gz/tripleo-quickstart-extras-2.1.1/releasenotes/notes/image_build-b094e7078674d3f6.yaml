    Because of very long image modifying by libguestfs, we now implement
    a different way to do it by converting image to raw, mounting it
    and modifying in the place (usual tripleo-ci way
    to do it, as it was before transition to quickstart).
    This implementation might be temporary until we figure what happens
    with libguestfs.
