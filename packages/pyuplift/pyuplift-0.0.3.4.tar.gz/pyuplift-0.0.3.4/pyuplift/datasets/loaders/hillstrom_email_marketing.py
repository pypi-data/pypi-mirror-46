    Data description
    ****************
    This dataset contains 64,000 customers who last purchased within twelve months.
    The customers were involved in an e-mail test.

     * 1/3 were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Mens merchandise.
     * 1/3 were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Womens merchandise.
     * 1/3 were randomly chosen to not receive an e-mail campaign.

    During a period of two weeks following the e-mail campaign, results were tracked.
    Your job is to tell the world if the Mens or Womens e-mail campaign was successful.
