class GitMetadataUpdater(handlers.MetadataUpdater):
  """
  This class implements updating metadata stored in git repositories.
  The update process is still mostly handled by the updater. This
  class is only supposed to implement loading of metadata from
  a git repository and keeping track of the current commit.
  Since we do not want to change the clients repository until
  we know it is safe to use git pull, the update works as follows:
  - The repository containing the metadata files is cloned to the temp folder.
  - The most recent commit in the client's local repository is determined. Based
  on that all new commits (newer than the client's most recent one in the
  cloned repository) are found.
  - A commit is considered to be a TUF mirror. We keep track of the current commit.
  - This class is designed in such a way that for each subsequent call of the
  updater's refresh method the next commit is used as a mirror. There are many
  reasons why this is better than instantiating this class multiple time:
      - We would have to clone the repository again. Passing already created GitRepo
      object to this class would require more substantial changes of the updater.
      - We would have to either merge just one commit into the clients repository
      after one refresh is successfully finished, or we would need to pass in the
      current commit to this class - meaning that the updater would have to be modified.
  - The updater's method '_get_metadata_file' call 'get_mirrors'. It then iterates
  through these mirrors and tries to update a metadata file by downloading them
  from each mirror, until a valid metadata is downloaded. If none of the mirrors
  contains valid metadata, an exception is raised. So, what we want to do is to
  return the current commit, and just the current commit. This means that that an
  exception will be raised if the version of the metadata file at that commit
  is not valid.
  Attributes:
      - repository_directory: the client's local repositoy's location
      - current_path: path of the 'current' directory needed by the updater
      - previous_path: path of the 'previous' directory needed by the updater
      - validation_auth_repo: a fresh clone of the metadata repository. It is
      a bare git repository. An instance of the `BareGitRepo` class.
      - users_auth_repo: an instance of the `GitRepo` class. The user's current
      git repository.
      - commits: a list of commits, starting with the most recent commit in the
      user's repository. The following commits are those committed after the
      the top one if the client's repo.
      - commits_indexes: a dictionary which stores intex of the current commit
      per metadata file. The reason for separating the metadata files is that
      not all files are updated at the same time.

    Args:
    mirrors: is a dictionary which contains information about each mirror:
                mirrors = {'mirror1': {'url_prefix': 'http://localhost:8001',
                           'metadata_path': 'metadata',
                           'targets_path': 'targets',
                           'confined_target_dirs': ['']}}
    This dictionary is provided by the user of the updater and used to
    create an instance of the tuf updater.
    We use url_prefix to specify url of the git repository which we want to clone.
    repository_directory: the client's local repositoy's location
