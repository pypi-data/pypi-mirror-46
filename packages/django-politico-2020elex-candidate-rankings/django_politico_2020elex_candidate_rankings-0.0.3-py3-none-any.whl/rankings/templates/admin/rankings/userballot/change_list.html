    <p>Rank <b>10</b> of the following candidates based on who you feel <b>most likely to be the eventual democratic nominee</b>, with 1 being the most likely. No two candidates can share the same rank.</p>
    <p>You may add notes to explain your ranking for each candidate. Contact Steve Shephard if a candidate you'd put in your top 10 is not available.</p>
