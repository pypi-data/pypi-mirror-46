\section Purpose

The purpose of this page is to describe the geometry format used in RTK to
relate a tomography to projection images. There is currently only one geometry
format, ThreeDCircularProjectionGeometry.

\section Units

 - Degrees are used to store angles in the geometry objects. Angles are
 wrapped between 0 and 360 degrees.
 - No unit is enforced for distances but it is the responsibility of the
 user to have a consistent unit for all distances (pixel and voxel spacings,
 geometry parameters...). Millimeters are typically used in ITK and DICOM.

\section ICS Image coordinate system

An \p itk::Image<> contains information to convert voxel indices to physical
coordinates using its members \p m_Origin, \p m_Spacing and \p m_Direction.
Voxel coordinates are not used in RTK except for internal computation. The
conversion from voxel index coordinates to physical coordinates and the
dimensions of the images are out of the scope of this document. In the
following, origin refers to point with coordinates \f$\vec{0}\f$ mm (and not to
\p m_Origin in ITK).

\section FCS Fixed coordinate system

The fixed coordinate system \f$(x,y,z)\f$ in RTK is the coordinate system of the
tomography with the isocenter at the origin \f$(0,0,0)\f$.

\section PG ProjectionGeometry<TDimension>

This is the mother class for relating a TDimension-D tomography to a
(TDimension-1)-D projection image. It holds a vector of
(TDimension)x(TDimension+1) projection matrices accessible via
\p GetMatrices. The construction of those matrices is geometry dependent.

\section TDCPG ThreeDCircularProjectionGeometry

This class is meant to define a set of 2D projection images, acquired with a
flat panel along a circular trajectory, around a 3D tomography. The trajectory
does not have to be strictly circular but it is assumed in some reconstruction
algorithms that the rotation axis is y. The description of the geometry is
based on the international standard IEC 61217 which has been designed for
cone-beam imagers on isocentric radiotherapy systems but it can be used for any
3D circular trajectory. The fixed coordinate system of RTK and the fixed
coordinate system of IEC 61217 are the same.

9 parameters are used per projection to define the position of the source and
the detector relatively to the fixed coordinate system. The 9 parameters are
set with the method \p AddProjection. Default values are provided for the
parameters which are not mandatory. Note that explicit names have been used but
this does not necessarily correspond to the value returned by the scanner which
can use its own parameterization.

\subsection DO Detector orientation

\subsubsection IDO Initial detector orientation

With all parameters set to 0, the detector is normal to the z direction of the
fixed coordinate system, similarly to the x-ray image receptor in the IEC
61217.

\subsubsection RO Rotation order

Three rotation angles are used to define the
orientation of the detector. The ZXY convention of Euler angles is used for
detector orientation where GantryAngle is the rotation around y,
OutOfPlaneAngle the rotation around x and InPlaneAngle the rotation around z.
These three angles are detailed in the following.

\subsubsection GantryAngle

Gantry angle of the scanner. It corresponds to \f$\phi g\f$ in Section 2.3 of IEC
61217:

> The rotation of the "g" system is defined by the rotation of coordinate axes
> Xg, Zg by an angle \f$\phi g\f$ about axis Yg (therefore about Yf of the "f"
> system).
>
> An increase in the value of \f$\phi g\f$ corresponds to a clockwise rotation of the
> GANTRY as viewed along the horizontal axis Yf from the ISOCENTRE towards the
> GANTRY.

\subsubsection OutOfPlaneAngle

Out of plane rotation of the flat panel complementary to the GantryAngle
rotation, i.e. with a rotation axis perpendicular to the gantry rotation axis
and parallel to the flat panel. It is optional with a default value equals to
0. There is no corresponding rotation in IEC 61217. After gantry rotation, the
rotation is defined by the rotation of the coordinate axes y and z about x.  An
increase in the value of OutOfPlaneAngle corresponds to a counter-clockwise
rotation of the flat panel as viewed from a positive value along the x axis
towards the isocenter.

\subsubsection InPlaneAngle

In plane rotation of the 2D projection. It is optional with 0 as default value.
If OutOfPlaneAngle equals 0, it corresponds to \f$\theta r\f$ in Section 2.6 of IEC
61217:


> The rotation of the "r" system is defined by the rotation of the coordinate
> axes Xr, Yr about Zr (parallel to axis Zg) by an angle \f$\theta r\f$.
>
> An increase in the value of angle \f$\theta r\f$ corresponds to a counter-clockwise
> rotation of the X- RAY IMAGE RECEPTOR as viewed from the RADIATION SOURCE.

\subsubsection RM Rotation matrix

The rotation matrix in homogeneous coordinate is then (constructed with
\p itk::Euler3DTransform<double>::ComputeMatrix() with opposite angles
because we rotate the volume coordinates instead of the scanner):

\f[
  \begin{split}
  M_R = &
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos(-InPlaneAngle) & -\sin(-InPlaneAngle) & 0 & 0\\
    \sin(-InPlaneAngle) & \cos(-InPlaneAngle) & 0 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}\\
  &\times
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & \cos(-OutOfPlaneAngle) & -\sin(-OutOfPlaneAngle) & 0\\
    0 & \sin(-OutOfPlaneAngle) & \cos(-OutOfPlaneAngle) & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}\\
  &\times
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos(-GantryAngle) & 0 & \sin(-GantryAngle) & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    -\sin(-GantryAngle) & 0 & \cos(-GantryAngle) & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}
  \end{split}
\f]

\subsection Drawings

The following drawing describes the parameters of the source and the detector
positions in the rotated coordinate system \f$(Rx,Ry,Rz)\f$ (i.e., oriented
according to the detector orientation), with its origin at the isocenter, when
all values are positive (but all distances can be negative in this geometry):

\image html http://www.openrtk.org/RTK/img/ThreeDCircularProjectionGeometry.svg

These 6 parameters are used to describe any source and detector positions. It
is simpler to understand the circular geometry when all Offset values equal 0 :

\subsection SP Source position

The source position is defined with respect to the isocenter with three
parameters, SourceOffsetX, SourceOffsetY and SourceToIsocenterDistance.
(SourceOffsetX,SourceOffsetY,SourceToIsocenterDistance) are the coordinates of
the source in the rotated coordinated system. In IEC 61217,
SourceToIsocenterDistance is the RADIATION SOURCE axis distance, SAD.
SourceOffsetX and SourceOffsetY are optional and zero by default.

\subsection DP Detector position

The detector position is defined with respect to the source with three
parameters: ProjectionOffsetX, ProjectionOffsetY and SourceToDetectorDistance.
(ProjectionOffsetX,ProjectionOffsetY,SourceToIsocenterDistance-SourceToDetectorDistance)
are the coordinates of the detector origin \f$(0,0)\f$ in the rotated
coordinated system. In IEC 61217, SourceToDetectorDistance is the RADIATION
SOURCE to IMAGE RECEPTION AREA distance, SID. ProjectionOffsetX and
ProjectionOffsetY are optional and zero by default.

\subsection FM Final matrix

Each matrix, accessible via \p GetMatrices, is constructed with:

\f[
  \begin{split}
  M_P =
  &\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & SourceOffsetX-ProjectionOffsetX  \\
    0 & 1 & SourceOffsetY-ProjectionOffsetY  \\
    0 & 0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}\\
  &\times
  \begin{pmatrix}
    -SourceToDetectorDistance & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
    0 & -SourceToDetectorDistance & 0 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & -SourceToIsocenterDistance
  \end{pmatrix}\\
  &\times
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & -SourceOffsetX  \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & -SourceOffsetY  \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}\\
  &\times
  M_R
  \end{split}
\f]

\subsection DR Detector radius

In addition to flat panel detectors, some of the forward and back projectors in
RTK can handle cylindrical detectors. The radius of the cylindrical detector is
stored only once, as the variable RadiusCylindricalDetector. The default value for
RadiusCylindricalDetector is 0, and indicates that the detector is a flat panel
(i.e. infinite radius, but 0 is easier to deal with). When the value is
non-zero, then the flat detector is curved according to the radius and remain
tangent to the corresponding flat detector along the line defined by the
detector origin \f$(0,0)\f$ and second axis of the detector. This is
illustrated in the following scheme:

\image html http://www.openrtk.org/RTK/img/ThreeDCircularProjectionGeometry_cylindrical.svg

This scheme is based on the previous one with all offsets equal 0 but this is not required.

\subsection ParG Parallel geometry

When SourceToDetectorDistance is set to 0, the geometry is assumed to be
parallel (i.e. infinite distance, but 0 is easier to deal with). The detector
is then flat. The rays are perpendicular to the detector plane which is
oriented similarly to the divergent geometry.  The (plane) source is actually
placed at a distance SourceToIsocenterDistance from the isocenter and the
detector is placed symetrically around the origin \f$(0,0,0)\f$ at the same
SourceToIsocenterDistance. This is summarized in the following scheme:

\image html http://www.openrtk.org/RTK/img/ThreeDCircularProjectionGeometry_parallel.svg

In this case, the projection matrix becomes:

\f[
  M_P =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & -ProjectionOffsetX  \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & -ProjectionOffsetY  \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}
  \times M_R.
\f]

\subsection XF XML file

ThreeDCircularProjectionGeometry can be saved and loaded from an XML file. If
the parameter is equal to the default value for all projections, it is not
stored in the file. If it is equal for all projections but different from the
default value, it is stored once. Otherwise, it is stored for each projection.
The matrix is given for information. It is read and checked to be consistent
with the parameters but a manual modification of the file must consistently
modify both the parameters and the matrix. An example is given hereafter:
