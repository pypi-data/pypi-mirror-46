Description: # Dolosse
        Dolosse uses modern tools such as Kafka and PostgreSQL to provide a scientific data acquisition 
        framework. The project is python based, which allows us to take advantage of a vast array of analysis
        libraries.
        
        ## Source Organization
        We are actively designing the software.  The basic organization will change drastically as we start 
        to determine the components and pieces.  
        
        ## Licensing
        We license the software under the Apache License 2.0. See the LICENSE for more information. Each 
        contributor is expected to put their name in their code.
