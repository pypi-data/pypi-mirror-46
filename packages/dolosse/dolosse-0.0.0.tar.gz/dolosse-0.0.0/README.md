# Dolosse
Dolosse uses modern tools such as Kafka and PostgreSQL to provide a scientific data acquisition 
framework. The project is python based, which allows us to take advantage of a vast array of analysis
libraries.

## Source Organization
We are actively designing the software.  The basic organization will change drastically as we start 
to determine the components and pieces.  

## Licensing
We license the software under the Apache License 2.0. See the LICENSE for more information. Each 
contributor is expected to put their name in their code.
