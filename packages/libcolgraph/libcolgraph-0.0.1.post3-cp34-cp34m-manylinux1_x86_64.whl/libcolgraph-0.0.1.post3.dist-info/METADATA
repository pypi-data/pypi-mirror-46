## coloring-graphs
a coloring graphs library written in C++ for speedy computation and wrapped in
Python for ease of development and extension!

### what
this library provides support to construct graphs and their coloring graphs.
a coloring graph is a metagraph representing all the valid colorings of a graph.
each vertex of a coloring graph represents a coloring of the base graph.

in this project, we represent a coloring as an integer, which, when converted to
base k (for a k-coloring), represents the vertex-wise colors [0,k).

the library is under development being written using Python and C/C++.
for documentation, feel free to take a look inside `lib/` and read the docstrings.
for examples, see the files in `test/`.
for questions, reach out.

### how
1. installation:

    - [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/libcolgraph/)

        `python3 -m pip install libcolgraph`

    - manual installation
        clone the repository
        - ssh:
        `git clone git@github.com:aalok-sathe/coloring-graphs`
        - https:
        `git clone https://github.com/aalok-sathe/coloring-graphs`

        go into the repository
        `cd coloring-graphs`

        install the prerequisites
        - using the make utility:
        `make install`


2. quickstart:

    - usage:

    `import libcolgraph`

    - run a test suite!
    `make test`

    - try the sandbox file (`test/sandbox.py`) to see how plotting works (python-only)
        - `python3 test/sandbox.py 3`
        - `python3 test/sandbox.py 3 test/input/g1.in`
