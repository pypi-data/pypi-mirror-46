Description: ## coloring-graphs
        repository to house coloring graphs code
        
        ### what
        this library provides support to construct graphs and their coloring graphs.
        a coloring graph is a metagraph representing all the valid colorings of a graph.
        each vertex of a coloring graph represents a coloring of the base graph.
        
        in this project, we represent a coloring as an integer, which, when converted to
        base k (for a k-coloring), represents the vertex-wise colors [0,k).
        
        the library is a WIP, and is being written using Python and C/C++.
        for documentation, feel free to take a look inside `lib/` and read the docstrings.
        for examples, see the files in `test/`.
        for questions, reach out.
        
        ### how
        1. installation:
        
            clone the repository
            - ssh:
            `git clone git@github.com:aalok-sathe/coloring-graphs`
            - https:
            `git clone https://github.com/aalok-sathe/coloring-graphs`
            
            go into the repository
            `cd coloring-graphs`
            
            install the prerequisites
            - using the make utility:
            `make install`
            
            - manually:
                - with sudo privileges:
                `sudo python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt`
                - without privileges:
                `python3 -m pip install --user -U -r requirements.txt`
            
            
        2. quickstart:
        
            - run a test suite!
            `make test`
            
            - try the sandbox file (`test/sandbox.py`) to see how plotting works
                - `python3 test/sandbox.py 3`
                - `python3 test/sandbox.py 3 test/input/g1.in`
