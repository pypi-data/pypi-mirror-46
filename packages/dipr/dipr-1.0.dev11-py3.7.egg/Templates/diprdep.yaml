# diprdep.yaml - The dipr dependency list
#
# A dependency is a readonly repo pulled down and set to the appropriate version.
#

#   REVISION: <revision hash>  (or)
#   TAG: <tag name>            (or)
#   BRANCH: <branch name>
#
# Where:
#   - PATH is where the repository will be located on disk relative to the .dipr directory.  Directories should
#     be specified in posix forward slash (/) fashion.
