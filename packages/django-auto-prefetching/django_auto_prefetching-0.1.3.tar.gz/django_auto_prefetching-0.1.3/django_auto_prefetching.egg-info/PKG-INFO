        Automatic prefetching of related objects for Django Rest Framework.
        
        Inside your ViewSets `get_queryset` add the following code:
        ```python3.7
            def get_queryset():
                qs = YOUR_MODEL.objects.all() # Or whatever queryset you want to use
                qs = prefetch(self.get_serializer_class(), queryset) # This line prefetches the related model depending on the serializer.
                return qs
        ```
        
        # Unresolved issues
        
        - If you forget to add `many=True` to a serializer that has the reverse side of the ForeignKey we calculate the wrong prefetch_related
        fields and we get an error. We can't catch this error early because it's only thrown when the queryset is evaluated
        - We can't prefetch anything that's accessed in serializer method fields.
