# Cavitometer Deconvolve

Cavitometer Deconvolve is a small library that converts hydrophone voltages into pressures using frequency dependent
sensitivity values. The library also supports voltage corrections due to pre-amplifiers.

## Installation
```bash
pip install cavitometer-deconvolve
```

## Usage
See [docs/examples.rst](https://github.com/blebon/cavitometer-deconvolve/blob/master/docs/examples.rst) 
for usage examples.
