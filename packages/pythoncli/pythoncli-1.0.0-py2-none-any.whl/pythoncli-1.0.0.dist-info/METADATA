Shablona is a template project for small scientific python projects. The
recommendations we make here follow the standards and conventions of much of
the scientific Python eco-system. Following these standards and recommendations
will make it easier for others to use your code, and can make it easier for you
to port your code into other projects and collaborate with other users of this
eco-system.


### Organization of the  project

The project has the following structure:

    pythoncli/
      |- README.md
      |- pythoncli/
         |- __init__.py
         |- __main__.py
         |- classmodule.py
         |- effectsmodule.py
         |- funcmodule.py
         |- loadingmodule.py
         |- resamplemodule.py
         |- supereffectmodule.py
      |- pythoncli.egg-info/
         |- dependency_links.txt
         |- entry_points.txt
         |- PKG-INFO
         |- SOURCES.txt
         |- top_level.txt
      |- setup.py
      |- install.sh
      |- LICENSE
      |- .gitignore

In the following sections we will examine these elements one by one. First,
let's consider the core of the project. This is the code inside of
`pythoncli/__main__.py`. The code provided in this file is intentionally rather
simple. It implements some simple command routing each to its specific file from the input string taken thought the terminal.

### Module code

We place the module code in a file called `__main__.py` in directory called
`pythoncli`. This structure  is a simple way to create a structure for the project ,
we also need to also create a file in `__init__.py` which contains code that imports
everything in that file into the namespace of the project:

    from .effectsmodule import *

In the module code, we follow the convention that all functions are either
imported from other places, or are defined in lines that precede the lines that
use that function. This helps readability of the code, because you know that if
you see some name, the definition of that name will appear earlier in the file,
either as a function/variable definition, or as an import from some other module
or package.


### Installation

For installation and distribution we will use the python standard
library `distutils` module. This module uses a `setup.py` file to
figure out how to install your software on a particular system. For a
small project such as this one, managing installation of the software
modules and the data is rather simple.

This also makes it possible to install your software with using `pip` and
`easy_install`, which are package managers for Python software. The
`setup.py` file reads this information from there and passes it to the
`setup` function which takes care of the rest.



### Continuous integration

Still have not chosen a Continous Intregration / Deployment methods.

### Distribution

The main venue for distribution of Python software is the [Python
Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/), or PyPI, also lovingly known
as "the cheese-shop".

To distribute your software on PyPI, you will need to create a user account on
[PyPI](http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/distributing/#register-your-project).
It is recommended that you upload your software using
[twine](http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/distributing/#upload-your-distributions).

Using Travis, you can automatically upload your software to PyPI,
every time you push a tag of your software to github. The instructions
on setting this up can be found
[here](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pypi/). You will need
to install the travis command-line interface

### Scripts

A scripts directory can be used as a place to experiment with your
module code, and as a place to produce scripts that contain a
narrative structure, demonstrating the use of the code, or producing
scientific results from your code and your data and telling a story
with these elements.

For example, this repository contains an [IPython notebook] that reads
in some data, and creates a figure. Maybe this is *Figure 1* from some
future article? You can see this notebook fully rendered
[here](https://github.com/uwescience/shablona/blob/master/scripts/Figure1.ipynb).

Example of a sript :
`pip install -e .`
Which allows the project to be updated inside the pip directory as it is registered as under development or development mode .

### Git Configuration

Currently there is 1 file  in the repository which help working
with this repository, and which you could extend further:

- `.gitignore` -- specifies intentionally untracked files (such as
  compiled `*.pyc` files), which should not typically be committed to
  git (see `man gitignore`)
