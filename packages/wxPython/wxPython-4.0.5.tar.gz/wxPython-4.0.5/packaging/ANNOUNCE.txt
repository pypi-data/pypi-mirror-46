Announcing wxPython 4.0.5
=========================

PyPI:   https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/4.0.5
Extras: https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/
Pip:    ``pip install wxPython==4.0.5``

Changes in this release include the following:


* Added missing HtmlWindow.ScrollToAnchor method, and also a couple methods 
  in HtmlCell too. (#1141)

* Added missing setters for the wheel-related properties in wx.MouseEvent. 
  (#1140)

* Updated wxWidgets commit reference, bringing fixes for #1140, #1086 and 
  #1147.

* Fix the use of the output parameter in HtmlWindow.OnOpeningURL the same way 
  it was fixed in HtmlWindowInterface.OnHTMLOpeningURL. (#1068)

* Fixed a crashing bug when using a member of a transient wx.VisualAttributes
  object. Also set the attributes to be read-only to simplify the fix. (#1198).
  
* Updated the sip being used in wxPython builds to version 4.19.16.

* Added helper functions to check results of wxWidgets configure during the
  build of wxPython. Currently used to determine if the wx webview, glcanvas,
  and media libraries should be added to the link command. (#1138)

* Fixed scrollbar issue with ListCtrlAutoWidthMixin (#1215)

* Fixed file access in the wx.py and wx.tools.pywxrc packages to be Python 2 and
  3 compatible. (#1193, #1156)

* Fixes for building with Python 3.8 on Linux. (#1227)





What is wxPython?
-----------------

wxPython is a cross-platform GUI toolkit for the Python programming
language.  It allows Python programmers to create programs with a
robust, highly functional graphical user interface, simply and
easily. It is implemented as a set of Python extension modules that
wrap the GUI components of the popular wxWidgets cross platform
library, which is written in C++. Supported platforms are Microsoft
Windows, Mac OS X and macOS, and Linux or other unix-like systems with
GTK2 or GTK3 libraries. In most cases the native widgets are used on
each platform to provide a 100% native look and feel for the
application.


What is wxPython Phoenix?
-------------------------

wxPython's Project Phoenix is a new from-the-ground-up implementation
of wxPython, created with the intent of making wxPython “better,
stronger, faster than he was before.” In other words, this new
implementation is focused on improving speed, maintainability and
extensibility of wxPython, as well as removing most of the cruft that
had accumulated over the long life of Classic wxPython.

The project has been in development off and on, mostly behind the
scenes, for many years. For the past few years automated snapshot
builds have been available for those adventurous enough to try it, and
many people eventually started using the snapshots in their projects,
even for production releases.  While there are still some things on
the periphery that need to be completed, the core of the new wxPython
extension modules which wrap the wxWidgets code has been stable for a
long time now.

Due to some things being cleaned up, reorganized, simplified and
dehackified wxPython Phoenix is not completely backwards compatible
with wxPython Classic.  This is intended. In general, however, the API
differences tend to be minor and some applications can use Phoenix
with slight, or even with no modifications.  In some other cases the
correct way to do things was also available in Classic and it's only
the wrong way that has been removed from Phoenix.  For more
information there is a Migration Guide document available at:
https://docs.wxpython.org/MigrationGuide.html

The new wxPython API reference documentation, including all
Python-specific additions and customizations, and docs for the wx.lib
package, is located at: https://docs.wxpython.org/
