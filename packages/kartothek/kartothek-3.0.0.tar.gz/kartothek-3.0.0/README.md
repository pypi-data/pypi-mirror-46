Datasets are a collection of files with the same schema that reside in
a storage. `kartothek` offers a metadata definition to handle these datasets
efficiently. In addition, the `kartothek.io` module provides building
blocks to create and modify these datasets. Handling of I/O, tracking of
dataset partitions and selecting subsets of data are handled transparently.

---------------------------

A Kartothek (or more modern: Zettelkasten/Katalogkasten) is a tool to organize
(high-level) information extracted from a source of information.
