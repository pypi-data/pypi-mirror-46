Sequence Modeling Benchmarks and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)
======================================================================

This repository contains the experiments done in the work [An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01271) by Shaojie Bai, J. Zico Kolter and Vladlen Koltun.

We specifically target a comprehensive set of tasks that have been repeatedly used to compare the effectiveness of different recurrent networks, and evaluate a simple, generic but powerful (purely) convolutional network on the recurrent nets' home turf.

Experiments are done in PyTorch. If you find this repository helpful, please cite our work:
