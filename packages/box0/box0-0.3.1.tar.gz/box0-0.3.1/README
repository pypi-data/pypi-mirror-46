pyBox0
======

Python binding for libbox0

Dependencies
============

* cffi
* numpy

In C:

* libbox0

Installation
============

$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install

Configuration
=============
in local.properties
	_binding.py, build_path variable to tell where to look for header and library

Usage
=====

lots of demo code in test/ and example/
a generic approch to opening device and module and do something with them

```
import box0

# open any supported usb device
dev = box0.usb.open_supported()

# open the dio0 module (assuming the device support it)
# if you need to iterate over the supported modules using dev
dio0 = dev.dio(0)

# Prepare for basic mode (basic functionality)
dio0.basic_prepare()

# set to output mode
dio0.dir(0, dio0.OUTPUT)

# set value of pin 0
dio0.value(0, dio0.LOW)

#disable hiz mode of pin 0,
# note: all pins are in hiz mode right after opening (for protection)
dio0.hiz(0, dio0.DISABLE)

# start the basic mode
dio0.basic_start()

# wait
try:
	while True:
		time.sleep(.5)
except:
	pass

# Stop basic mode
dio0.basic_stop()

# close resources
dio0.close()
dev.close()
```

Note
====
pyBox0 uses same style as libbox0 and
 much of the documentation of libbox0 is applicable to pyBox0

`int b0_<section>_<func>(<section-object>, params....)`

in pyBox0:
	instead of int, an exception (ResultException is raised) when int-val < 0
	so, now the return value is used for other tasks

	"b0" tag is now replace with "box0." as python have concept of modules

	<section> is replace with files.
		for example: <section> = "device" , theirs device.py
			and it contain Device.py


	<func> these are under-scored style name in libbox0
		in pyBox0, camelcasing is used
		for example b0_usb_open_supported() is box0.usb.open_supported()

	most of the library assumes numpy array.
		numpy is good and you should always use numpy with pyBox0 as
		it much better in long run
