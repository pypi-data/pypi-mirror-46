=====
PtvPy
=====
A command line tool and Python library for particle tracking velocimetry.
Its goal is to give domain experts an intuitive tool that provides reproducible
and reliable results without requiring programming skills. PtvPy heavily depends
on and extends functionality from the excellent library trackpy_. It furthermore
provides a periphery to visualize, analyze and export the data involved.
