        PtvPy
        =====
        A command line tool and Python library for particle tracking velocimetry.
        Its goal is to give domain experts an intuitive tool that provides reproducible
        and reliable results without requiring programming skills. PtvPy heavily depends
        on and extends functionality from the excellent library trackpy_. It furthermore
        provides a periphery to visualize, analyze and export the data involved.

        History
        =======
        PtvPy was developed as an internal tool at the `Chair of Measurement & Sensor System
        Technique`_ at the TU Dresden to facilitate data analysis. It was eventually published
        in 2019 as open source software.
