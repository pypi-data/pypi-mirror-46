    """
    Read a dbf file as a pandas.DataFrame, optionally selecting the index
    variable and which columns are to be loaded.

    Arguments
    ---------
    dbf_path    : str
                  Path to the DBF file to be read
    index       : str
                  Name of the column to be used as the index of the DataFrame
    cols        : list
                  List with the names of the columns to be read into the
                  DataFrame. Defaults to False, which reads the whole dbf
    incl_index  : Boolean
                  If True index is included in the DataFrame as a
                  column too. Defaults to False
