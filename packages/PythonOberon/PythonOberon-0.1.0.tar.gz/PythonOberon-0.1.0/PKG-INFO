        A hardware emulator for the new RISC processor written in Python.  If
        Pygame is available it will open a screen of the standard dimensions of
        1024 x 768 pixels.  I've also implemented a very crude "assembler" which
        is really little more than a bunch of helper functions to emit binary
        instructions (in the form of 32-bit-wide ints.  However, it also provides
        a function dis() that will return a string representing the (integer)
        instruction passed to it.
        
        Start with:
        
        ```
        python -i -m oberon
        ```
        
        This will use `disk.img` by default.  At around 3400000 cycles the screen
        background begins to fill in, and at around 6500000 cycles the window
        content begins to be drawn:

        (The `-i` option tells Python to drop into interactive REPL mode after
        the script has run.  You can interact with the risc object.)
