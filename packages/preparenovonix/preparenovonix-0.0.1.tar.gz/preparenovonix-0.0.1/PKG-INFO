        Prepare Novonix Data
        ====================
        
        This code handles common issues encountered in files generated with a
        range of `Novonix`_ software versions and it can add extra information.
        There is a master function *prepare_novonix* that can run at once
        all the available features, providing also flexibility to only choose
        some.
        
        The code can be used to test if a file has the expected structure for a
        `Novonix`_ file (*isnovoix* function) and to read a specific column
        from a raw `Novonix`_ file (*read_column* function). Files can be
        cleanned from empty lines and characters added after the ']' in the
        header and failed tests are handled by modifying the capacity column to
        start at the sum of the capacities from the failed tests, instead of 0
        (*cleannovonix* function).
        
        The extra information that can be created for **cleaned** files
        (functions: *novonix_add_state* and *novonix_add_loopnr*) is:
        
        -  A 'State' column with 0 for the first measurement of a particular
           step, 1 for regular data points, 2 to indicate the last measurement
           in that series and -1 for single measurements.
        -  A reduced protocol with one command per numerated line.
        -  A 'Protocol line' column that makes reference to the reduced protocol
           lines.
        -  A 'Loop number' column with 0s when commands are not repeated and
           monotoncally increasing integers starting from 1, to indicate the
           repetition number.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        This code has been developed in Python 3.7.1 and tested from Matlab and
        within PowerShell and ConEmu BashShell in Windows 10.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        The **example.py** runs over the given example data. To run this
        example, simply type: :code:`python example.py`.
        
        Running this code from MatLab
        -----------------------------
        
        In your code add the 'pycode' folder to your search path:
        
        .. code-block:: Matlab
        		
           addpath(genpath('pycode'))
        
        Try to run the code catching exceptions:
        
        .. code-block:: Matlab
        		
           try
        	  py.pycode.novonix_add.prepare_novonix(file_to_open,pyargs('verbose','False','lprotocol','True'));
           catch e e.message if(isa(e,'matlab.exception.PyException'))
        	  e.ExceptionObject
           end
        
        Ensure that Matlab can see your installation of Python by running
        `pyversion`_. If Matlab cannot see python, once you know where your
        Python executable is (within a python terminal you can do this by
        typing: :code:`import os, sys ; os.path.dirname(sys.executable)`), type
        within your MatLab interpreter :code:`pyversion [path to python executable]`
        and check that now the path to Python was recognised with
        `pyversion`_.
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        This code has been tested with data generated by different versions of
        the `Novonix`_ software. If you encounter issues running the code for
        any version of Novonix software report an issue. Note that an example
        file will be needed in order to improve the code. List of the `Novonix`_
        software. If you encounter issues running the code for any version of Novonix software report an issue. Note that an example file will be needed in order to improve the code.
        List of the `Novonix`_ software versions the code has been tested against:
        
        -  3.0.2.3
        -  3.0.2.1
