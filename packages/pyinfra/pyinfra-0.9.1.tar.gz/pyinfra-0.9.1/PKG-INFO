        pyinfra is designed to automate/provision/manage/deploy servers at
        scale.
        
        It can be used for ad-hoc command execution, service deployment,
        configuration management; you could say that pyinfra is like a
        combination of Ansible + Fabric. It is asynchronous, highly performant
        and can target thousands of hosts in parallel. It is entirely configured
        in Python, allowing for near-infinite extendability out of the box.

        Design Features
        ---------------
        
        pyinfra was designed to deploy things in a consistent, debuggable and
        maintainable manner. Notable design decisions:
        
        -  properly agentless - even Python isn’t required on the remote side
           (just a shell!)
        -  always print raw stderr on operation failure for *instant* debugging
        -  ``-v`` means print out remote stdout & stderr in realtime
        -  outputs shell commands and files to upload
        -  two-step deploy that enables dry-runs
        -  fail fast where possible (eg touching a directory)
        -  uses pure, 100% Python for the inventory and deploy scripts
        
           -  with operations/hooks to safely use Python mid-deploy
