        # Filecrawl
        
        A simple crawler obtaining all available files from the campus management platforms
        Studip and moodle for University Trier
        
        ## Disclaimer
        This version works only for the University Trier and Studip 4.
        Use the [Studip RESTAPI](https://docs.studip.de/develop/Entwickler/RESTAPI)
        if possible as Crawlers are forbidden by many universities. 
        
        There are other open Source Clients supporting the API, e.g. [studip-fuse](https://github.com/N-Coder/studip-fuse)
        or [STUD.IP-FileSync](https://github.com/rockihack/Stud.IP-FileSync).
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Windows
        
        1. Download [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org)
        2. Download filecrawl and unzip it.
        3. open cmd
        4. ``` cd /path/to/filecrawl/ ```
        5. ```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
        
        ### MacOS and Linux
        1. Download [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org)
        2. Download filecrawl and unzip it.
        3. open terminal
        4. ``` cd /path/to/filecrawl/ ```
        5. ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
            + When you use a Linux Distro which isn't supported by the ```keyrings``` backend (e.g. Raspbian)
        you also need to run ```pip3 install keyrings.alt```
        ## Usage
        
        ### Windows
        Simply run the script with ``` python filecrawl.py ``` when you are in the filecrawl folder.
        It will guide you through the setup when you run the script for the first time.
        
        ### MacOS and Linux
        Simply run the script with ``` python3 filecrawl.py ``` when you are in the filecrawl folder.
        It will guide you through the setup when you run the script for the first time.
        + You may get an Error when using ```help``` in the Setup on macOS stating that ```FIFinderSyncExtensionHost``` is
        implemented in two paths - just ignore this. This also leads to a Finder window which is stuck
        as long as the script is running.
        
        #### Crontabs
        When you want to run filecrawl as a crontab, you have to have root privileges or run everything with ```sudo```.
        Also, you may have to change the path where the config will be saved in
        [filecrawl/L233](https://github.com/Xceron/Filecrawl/blob/1169aa817fd9e20a54c7f6fc2c406fc2e5fdc6c6/filecrawl.py#L233),
        [config_handling/L89](https://github.com/Xceron/Filecrawl/blob/04e178dad31a28cdeb0dd1002fec85b226681113/filecrawl/config_handling.py#L89)
        and [config_handling/L100](https://github.com/Xceron/Filecrawl/blob/04e178dad31a28cdeb0dd1002fec85b226681113/filecrawl/config_handling.py#L100)
        as the root user has no /User/ folder where the config will be stored.
