        This package aims to provide support for some type of radiospectra on solar physics.
        
        This uses SunPy underneath, which is an open-source Python library for Solar Physics data analysis and visualization.
        Our homepage `SunPy`_ has more information about the project.

        Installation
        ============
        
        The recommended way to install radiospectra is with `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`__.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ conda config --append channels conda-forge
            $ conda install radiospectra
        
        You can also use pip:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           pip install radiospectra
        
        If you are coming here from the ``Warning`` deprecation in SunPy you more probably need to change from::
        
           from sunpy.spectra.spectrum import Spectrum
        
        to::
        
           from radiospectra.spectrum import Spectrum
