r"""The Energy Mover's Distance (EMD), also known as the Earth Mover's 
Distance, is a metric between particle collider events introduced in
[1902.02346](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02346). This submodule contains
convenient functions for computing EMDs between individual events and
collections of events. The core of the computation is done using the
[Python Optimal Transport (POT)](https://pot.readthedocs.io) library,
which must be installed in order to use this submodule.

From Eq. 1 in [1902.02346](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02346), the EMD between
two events is the minimum ''work'' required to rearrange one event $\mathcal E$
into the other $\mathcal E'$ by movements of energy $f_{ij}$ from particle $i$ 
in one event to particle $j$ in the other:
$$
\text{EMD}(\mathcal E,\mathcal E^\prime)=\min_{\{f_{ij}\}}\sum_{ij}f_{ij}\frac{
\theta_{ij}}{R} + \left|\sum_iE_i-\sum_jE^\prime_j\right|,\\
f_{ij}\ge 0, \quad \sum_jf_{ij}\le E_i, \quad \sum_if_{ij}\le E^\prime_j, \quad 
\sum_{ij}f_{ij}=E_\text{min},
$$
where $E_i,E^\prime_j$ are the energies of the particles in the two events, 
$\theta_{ij}$ is an angular distance between particles, and 
$E_\text{min}=\min\left(\sum_iE_i,\,\sum_jE^\prime_j\right)$ is the smaller
of the two total energies. In a hadronic context, transverse momenta are used 
instead of energies.

        **Arguments**

        - **ev0** : _numpy.ndarray_
            - The first event, given as a two-dimensional array. The event is 
            assumed to be an `(M,1+gdim)` array of particles, where `M` is the 
            multiplicity and `gdim` is the dimension of the ground space in 
            which to compute euclidean distances between particles (as specified
            by the `gdim` keyword argument. The zeroth column is assumed to be
            the energies (or equivalently, the transverse momenta) of the 
            particles. For typical hadron collider jet applications, each 
            particle will be of the form `(pT,y,phi)` where  `y` is the rapidity
            and `phi` is the azimuthal angle.
        - **ev1** : _numpy.ndarray_
            - The other event, same format as **ev0**.
        - **R** : _float_
            - The R parameter in the EMD definition that controls the relative 
            importance of the two terms. Must be greater than or equal to half 
            of the maximum ground distance in the space in order for the EMD 
            to be a valid metric.
        - **norm** : _bool_
            - Whether or not to normalize the pT values of the events prior to 
            computing the EMD.
        - **return_flow** : _bool_
            - Whether or not to return the flow matrix describing the optimal 
            transport found during the computation of the EMD. Note that since
            the second term in Eq. 1 is implemented by including an additional 
            particle in the event with lesser total pT, this will be reflected 
            in the flow matrix.
        - **gdim** : _int_
            - The dimension of the ground metric space. Useful for restricting
            which dimensions are considered part of the ground space. Can be
            larger than the number of dimensions present in the events (in
            which case all dimensions will be included). If `None`, has no
            effect.
        - **n_iter_max** : _int_
            - Maximum number of iterations for solving the optimal transport 
            problem.
        - **periodic_phi** : _bool_
            - Whether to expect (and therefore properly handle) periodicity
            in the coordinate corresponding to the azimuthal angle $\phi$.
            Should typically be `True` for event-level applications but can
            be set to `False` (which is slightly faster) for jet applications
            where all $\phi$ differences are less than or equal to $\pi$.
        - **phi_col** : _int_
            - The index of the column of $\phi$ values in the event array.

        **Returns**

        - _float_
            - The EMD value.
        - [_numpy.ndarray_], optional
            - The flow matrix found while solving for the EMD. The `(i,j)`th 
            entry is the amount of `pT` that flows between particle i in `ev0`
            and particle j in `ev1`.

            or `None`. If the latter, the pairwise distances between events
            in `X0` will be computed and the returned matrix will be symmetric.

        - **n_jobs** : _int_ or `None`
            - The number of worker processes to use. A value of `None` will use 
            as many processes as there are CPUs on the machine. Note that for
            smaller numbers of events, a smaller value of `n_jobs` can be faster.
