Unlike git shell commands, ``gitone`` automatically generates commit messages with every command.

The ``gitone`` Python package consists of 4 shell commands and
functions:

- ``camp``, which stands for ``git commit -am`` and ``git push`` will add and commit all changes made to tracked files and push the changes to the remote repository.
- ``acmp``, which stands for ``git add``, ``git commit -m`` and ``git push`` will add and commit all changes made to all files and push the changes to the remote repository.
- ``cam``, which stands for ``git commit -am`` and ``git push`` will add and commit all changes made to tracked files.
- ``acm``, which stands for ``git add``, ``git commit -m`` and ``git push`` will add and commit all changes made to all files.
