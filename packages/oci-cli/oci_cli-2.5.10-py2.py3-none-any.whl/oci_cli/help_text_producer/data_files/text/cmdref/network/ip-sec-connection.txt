Description
===========

A connection between a DRG and CPE. This connection consists of

required when setting up an IPSec VPN. For more information, see IPSec
VPN.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

information when you supply string values using the API.
