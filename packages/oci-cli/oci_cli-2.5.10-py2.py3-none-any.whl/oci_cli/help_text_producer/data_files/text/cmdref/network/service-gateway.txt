service-gateway
***************


Description
===========

Represents a router that connects the edge of a VCN with public Oracle
Cloud Infrastructure services such as Object Storage. Traffic leaving
the VCN and destined for a supported public service (see ListServices)
is routed through the service gateway and does not traverse the
internet. The instances in the VCN do not need to have public IP
addresses nor be in a public subnet. The VCN does not need an internet
gateway for this traffic. For more information, see Access to Object
Storage: Service Gateway.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
