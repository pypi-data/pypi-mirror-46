.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Represents a router that connects the edge of a VCN with public Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services such as Object Storage. Traffic leaving the VCN and destined for a supported public service (see \fI\%ListServices\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Service/ListServices\fP>) is routed through the service gateway and does not traverse the internet. The instances in the VCN do not need to have public IP addresses nor be in a public subnet. The VCN does not need an internet gateway for this traffic. For more information, see \fI\%Access to Object Storage: Service Gateway\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/servicegateway.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS Description
.sp
Enables the specified service on the specified gateway. In other words, enables the service gateway to send traffic to the specified service. You must also set up a route rule with the service\(aqs \fIcidrBlock\fP as the rule\(aqs destination CIDR and the gateway as the rule\(aqs target. See \fI\%Route Table\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/RouteTable/\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP The \fIAttachServiceId\fP operation is an easy way to enable an individual service on the service gateway. Compare it with \fI\%UpdateServiceGateway\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/ServiceGateway/UpdateServiceGateway\fP>, which also lets you enable an individual service. However, with \fIUpdateServiceGateway\fP, you must specify the \fIentire\fP list of services you want enabled on the service gateway.

.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state.

The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp

.SS detach
.SS Description
.sp
Disables the specified service on the specified gateway. In other words, stops the service gateway from sending traffic to the specified service.

However, with \fIUpdateServiceGateway\fP, you must specify the \fIentire\fP list of services you want enabled on the service gateway. \fIUpdateServiceGateway\fP also lets you block all traffic through the service gateway without having to disable each of the individual services.

.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
