Description: # MoPy
        MoPy is a python package for calculating seismic source parameters.
        It is still very much a work in progress and not yet intended for non-development use.
        
        
        ## TODO
        
        * Rethink `ChanelInfo` to allow greater flexibility in how windows are selected
            - Maybe this would be best left as a function?
            - Should be easy to use for amplitude estimations
            - Should be usable for duration estimations (eg in Rodriguez-pradilla and Eaton)
            - Could use different channel info for each of these?
            
        * Check on how the continuous fft is simulated via dfft, 
            - Edwards et al (2010) indicate simply multiplying by sampling period will do it
              but then indicates noise spectra are normalized by non-zero padded sample number
              ratios (see page 409 first paragraph on left).
              However, this doesn't really make sense since, if we have properly
              simulated the *continuous* fourier transform amplitudes there should be no
              need for vector-length scaling.
