Description: A simple sitemap builder
        ========================
        
        The sitemap builder traverses links from a website and constrains itself to
        the given domain name. The final result will be a simple sitemap deduced
        from the links visited. The crawler will accept & process only URLs with
        http or https schemes.
        
        Installation and usage
        ======================
        
        To run the following command to install the tool:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install -U sitemapbuilder
        
        To run the sitemap builder:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            sitemapbuilder -u 'https://monzo.com' -o test_monzo.dot
        
        Some websites have strong protection and the tool will not work for them:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            sitemapbuilder -u 'https://bloomberg.com' -o test_bloomberg.dot
        
        Highlights
        ==========
        
        1. Generate Graphviz `.dot` file showing directed links between pages. One
        can generate PNG/PDF and other image/document formats.
        2. Have `configurable decay` (maximum depth) to avoid abuse.
        3. Visit web link within the same hostname by default.
        4. Use `5 threads` by default and times out after `10 seconds`.
        5. Timeout after `5 seconds` when fetching a URL.
        6. Handle timeout exceptions when querying a website.
        7. Send a `HTTP HEAD` request and verify that `Content-Type` is `text/html`
        and `charset` is either `UTF-8` or `US-ASCII`.
        8. Have a map of visited URLs to avoid revisiting them.
        9. Follow HTTP redirects.
        
        Upcoming features
        =================
        * Configure the number of threads and timeout via cmd args.
        * Allow web links from all subdomains.
        * Allow web links from a list of domains.
        * Allow web links matching a pattern.
        * Add an option for hierarchical sitemap instead of directed graph.
        * Use PriorityQueue instead of Queue to process links with higher decay first.
        * Fine-graned info, warn and error logging.
        * Pass seed links from a file.
