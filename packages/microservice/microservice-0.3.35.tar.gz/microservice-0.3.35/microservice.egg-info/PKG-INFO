Description: ## Powerful REST API *microservice* on Tornado
        
        ### Main goal
        Sometimes we need to deploy microservices like messenger bots (telegram, facebook), small backends, webhooks and other.
        This package contains all you need to setup simple endpoint in minutes with authorization, caching, and improved security.
        
        ### Features
        - tornado with improved basic handler for easy create REST endpoints
        - async non-blocking highly durable and scalable
        - handlers versioning (e.g. GET /**v2**/cat?color=blue)
        - request validation, answer containerization
        - poor documented, sorry :(
        
        ### Under the hood
        - tornado 5
        
        All features below are optional
        - peewee / peewee_async as ORM
          - User and session models
          - oauth support
        - simple redis caching
        - sentry integration + telegram reports
        - prometheus monitoring
        
        ### Testing
        1. PYTHONPATH=./microservice python test.py
        1. curl localhost:8001/v1/test | json_pp
        1. inspect test.py and enjoy
