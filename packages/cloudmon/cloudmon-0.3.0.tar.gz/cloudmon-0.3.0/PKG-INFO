Description: # CloudMon
        
        
        CloudMon is a monitoring orchestrator for clouds. Cloudmon integrates directly an IaaS plataform (currently works with Apache CloudStack and AWS EC2) with a monitoring plataform (Zabbix).
        
        
        On the fly, CloudMon will:
        
        * create, delete or change status of zabbix hosts (each host corresponds to an IaaS VM) and even update its configurations (templates, hostgroups, macros...) replicating the changes (created/removed/stopped) ocurred within the VMs.
        
        * Read VMs [resource tags](Tags.md) and take different actions based on its values.
        
        * Associate zabbix hosts to predefined templates or hostgroups.
        
        * Simultaneously monitor multiple Cloud regions (different or same IaaS).
        
        CloudMon works as a Python Daemon that retrieves IaaS data through CloudStack API, AWS EC2 API and/or its event queues, processing that data and taking the proper action in Zabbix through the Zabbix API.
        
        CloudMon requires a Zabbix Agent installed to ensure proper functionality.
        
        CloudMon has been tested and used in CentOS environments and Python 2.7.
        
        
        
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        * Read the [documentation](https://cloudmon.readthedocs.io)
        * Recommended to create a python virtualenv for CloudMon.
        * Install via `pip install cloudmon`.
        * Edit your `cloudmon.conf` file for your needs. See [Configuration](Configuration.md).
        * Create and edit one or more [managers](Managers.md).
        * Edit /etc/init.d/cloudmon if needed.
        * Run CloudMon with: `cloudmon` or `/etc/init.d/cloudmon start | stop | restart`. See [Usage](Usage.md).
        
        ## Success Stories
        
        CloudMon has been successfully used by Globo.com to monitor its Cloud Infrastructure.
