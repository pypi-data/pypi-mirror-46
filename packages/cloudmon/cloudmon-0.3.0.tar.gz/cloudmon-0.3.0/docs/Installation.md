# Installation

## Stable release

To install CloudMon, run this command in your terminal:

``` console
$ pip install cloudmon
```

This is the preferred method to install CloudMon, as it will always
install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python
installation
guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.

## From sources

The sources for CloudMon can be downloaded from the [Github
repo](https://github.com/globocom/cloudmon).

Or download the
[tarball](https://github.com/globocom/cloudmon/tarball/master):

``` console
$ curl  -OL https://github.com/globocom/cloudmon/tarball/master
```
