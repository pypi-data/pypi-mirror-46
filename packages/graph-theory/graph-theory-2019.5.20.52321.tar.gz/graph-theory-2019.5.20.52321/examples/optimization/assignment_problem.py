ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM

Definition:

The problem instance has a number of agents and a number of tasks. 
Any agent can be assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost that may 
vary depending on the agent-task assignment. It is required to perform all 
tasks by assigning exactly one agent to each task and exactly one task to each 
agent in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized.[1]

Variations:

- If there are more agents than tasks the problem can be solved by creating a
"do nothing tasks" with a cost of zero. The assignment problem solver does this
automatically.

- If there are more tasks than agents then the problem is a knapsack problem. 
The assignment problem solver handles this case gracefully too.


Solution methods:

1. Using maximum flow method.
2. Using alternating iterative auction.

def assignment_problem(graph):
    """ The assignment problem solver expects a bi-partite graph
    with agents, tasks and the value/cost of each task, as links,
    so that the relationship is explicit as:

        value = g.edge(agent 1, task 1)

    The optimal assignment is determined as an alternating auction
    (see Dmitri Bertsekas, MIT) which maximises the value.
    Once all agents are assigned the alternating auction halts.
