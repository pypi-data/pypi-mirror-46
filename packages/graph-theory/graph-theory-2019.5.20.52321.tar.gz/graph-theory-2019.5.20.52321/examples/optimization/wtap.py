Definition:

Weapons target assignment problem (WTAP)

The problem instance has a number weapons which can be assigned
to engage targets, with a success rate of P(x). Targets have values V.
If a weapon is engaged against a target, and is successful, the value is 
reduced to zero. Expected outcome of an engagement (D,T) is thereby

    O = V * (1-P(x))

The optimal assignment is minimises the value of the targets.

    min E( O )

[1].

Variations:

- if V is unknown, use v = 1. This maximises the exploitation of the available
probabilities.

Solution methods:

1. Dynamic programming problem.
2. Alternating iterative auction.
