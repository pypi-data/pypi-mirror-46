        # UbiCast Miris Manager client
        
        A Python3 client to use UbiCast Miris Manager remote control API.
        
        This client is intended to act as a system in Miris Manager so it allows you to integrate a device in order to control it using Miris Manager.
        
        
        ## Important
        
        For production use, it is recommended to use the branch named "stable". The "master" branch is used for development.
        
        
        ## Client class instantiation
        
        The client class (`mm_client`.`client`.`MirisManagerClient`) takes two arguments:
        * `local_conf`: This argument can be either a dict or a path (`str` object). The default value is `None`, which means no configuration.
        * `setup_logging`: This argument must be a boolean. If set to `True`, the logging to console will be configured. The default value is `True`.
        
        
        ## Notes about older client
        
        If you are using the first version of this client (commit `33b554991303b573254d59fb757f601d1e84d132` and previous commits), here are the steps to update your client:
        
        * Install the new client using the setup.py.
        * Replace the import path of `MirisManagerClient` (see example).
        * Replace the class variable `MirisManagerClient`.`LOCAL_CONF` with the class instance argument `MirisManagerClient`.`local_conf`.
        * Check the value of `MirisManagerClient`.`DEFAULT_CONF` because it is now `None` by default.
        * Replace all occurences of `URL` by `SERVER_URL` in all configuration.
        * Replace all occurences of `CHECK_SSL` by `VERIFY_SSL` in all configuration.
        
        
        ## Example
        
        ### Ping the server
        
        ``` python
        from mm_client.client import MirisManagerClient
        mmc = MirisManagerClient(local_conf='your-conf.json')
        
        response = mmc.api_request('PING')
        print(response)
        ```
        
        There are more examples in the `examples` directory.
        
        
        ## Actions
        
        Here is the list of actions that can be sent to the client depending on its supported capabilities:
