HTTPony
=======

HTTPony (pronounced aych-tee-tee-pony) is a simple HTTP server
that pretty prints HTTP requests to a terminal.
It is a useful aide for developing clients that send HTTP requests.
HTTPony acts as a sink for a client
so that a developer can understand what the client is sending.

HTTPony is `developed on GitHub <https://github.com/mblayman/httpony>`_.
