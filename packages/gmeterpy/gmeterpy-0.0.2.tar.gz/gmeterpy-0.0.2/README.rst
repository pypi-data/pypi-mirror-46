Gravity (small `g`) measurement data processing framework written in Python.

The goal of the gMeterPy is to create an open source software to process 
raw data from all types of gravimeters.

**The project is in the early planning and development stage.**

About
-----

*gMeterPy* is an open source and free Python library for processing 
measurement data from gravimeters, which are used for gravity field surveys 
in geodesy, geophysics and other branches of Earth and planetary sciences. 
The main intention is to go as deep as possible in processing **raw** data 
from scratch, as well as to support all types of instruments, 
corrections, common file formats and processing procedures.

Install
-------

You will need **Python 3.5 or greater**.
