Summary: 
hrds is a python package for obtaining points from a set of rasters at
different resolutions. You can request a point (or list of points) and
hrds will return a value based on the highest resolution dataset (as
defined by the user) available at that point, blending datasets in a
buffer region to ensure consistancy.
