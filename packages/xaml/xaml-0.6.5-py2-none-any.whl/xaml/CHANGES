0.6.1
=====

allow a trailing / to preserve preceding white space:

  ~some_item: some text with trailing WS:   /

becomes

  <some_item>some text with trailing WS:   </some_item>


0.6.0  -- BREAKING CHANGE
=====
XamlDoc is now a container for XamlPage's, which have the attributes a XamlDoc
used to have.

xaml files can now simultaneously contain several different docs, such as
xml, xsl, html, etc

__main__ script only supports writing all contained pages to a single file, or
to different files with extension based on document type (in other words, if a
file has two different xml docs in it the second created file will overwrite
the first -- making this work properly is a future enhancement).

allow ':' in names without backslash
backslash is only needed if ':' is the last character of the name

add support for html entities
keep backslashes

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE

The tag element symbol has changed from % to ~ as % is used in string
