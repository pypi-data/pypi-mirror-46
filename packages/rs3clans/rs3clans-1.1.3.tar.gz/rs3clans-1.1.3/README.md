- [`requests>=2.21.0`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)

## Setup with pip:

$ python3 -m pip install rs3clans
```

***

## Usage:

<details>
<summary>
> Players
</summary>

- Creating a Player object
    - Always check if a player actually exists before doing anything with it
```python
>>> from rs3clans import players
>>> player = players.Player(name='nriver')
>>> if player.exists:
...     pass
```

- Whether the player exists or not
```python
>>> player.exists
True
```

- Whether his Runemetrics Profile is Private or not
```python
>>> player.private_profile
False
```

- You can also pass the argument runemetrics as `False` if you don't want their runemetrics info to be set
    - This will make you unable to use some attributes from the Player class
```python
>>> player = players.Player(name='nriver', runemetrics=False)
```

- Getting a player's name
    - (if his Runemetrics Profile is private it will return the same name passed when creating object)
```python
>>> player.name
'NRiver'
```

- Getting a player's total Exp (requires Public Runemetrics Profile)
```python
>>> player.exp
1037291112
```

- Getting a player's Total Level (requires Public Runemetrics Profile)
```python
>>> player.total_level
```

- Getting a player's Combat Level (requires Public Runemetrics Profile)
```python
>>> player.combat_level
138
```

- Quests information about a player (requires Public Runemetrics Profile)
```python
>>> player.quests_not_started
32
>>> player.quests_started
5
>>> player.quests_complete
198
```

- Getting information on a specific skill of the player (requires Public Runemetrics Profile)
```python
>>> player.skill('agility').level
99
```

- Skill name is case-insensitive
```python
>>> player.skill('AtTaCk').rank
68311
```

- Can pass skill names as well as id
    - (8 = Woodcutting for example)
```python
>>> player.skill(8).exp
14054178.6
```

- Getting a player's title
```python
>>> player.title
'The Liberator'
```

- Verifying if a player's title is a suffix or not
```python
>>> player.suffix
True
```

- Getting a player's clan
```python
>>> player.clan
'Atlantis'
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>
> Clans
</summary>

- Creating a Clan object
    - Always check if a clan actually exists before doing anything with it
```python
>>> from rs3clans import clans
>>> try:
...     clan = clans.Clan('Atlantis')
... except clans.ClanNotFoundError:
...     print('Clan not found.')
```

- Getting a clan's total Exp
```python
>>> clan.exp
151349638333
```

- Getting information about a specific member in that clan
    - Clan.member attribute (dict) (requires case-sensitive name)
    - Clan.get_member() (method) (does not require case-sensitive name)
    - Returns a ClanMember Object
```python
>>> # Case-sensitive
>>> clan.member['NRiver']
ClanMember(NRiver, Overseer, 1043065027)
>>> clan.member['NRiver'].rank
'Overseer'
```

```python
>>> # Case-insensitive
>>> clan.get_member('nriver')
ClanMember(NRiver, Overseer, 1043065027)
>>> clan.get_member('nRiVeR').rank
'Overseer'
```

- Getting the number of players in a clan
```python
>>> clan.count
499
```

- Getting the average Clan Exp per player in clan
```python
>>> clan.avg_exp
303305888.44288576
```

- Iterate through a Clan
```python
>>> for member in clan:
>>>     print(f"{member} - {member.name}")
ClanMember(Pedim, Owner, 1249520826) - Pedim
ClanMember(Acriano, Overseer, 1903276564) - Acriano
ClanMember(Cogu, Overseer, 1829449412) - Cogu
