**Data visualisation in Python based on NVIDIA OptiX ray tracing framework.**

**Note:** this is an early, beta version. Active development and documentation is ongoing.

3D `ray tracing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)>`__ package for Python, aimed at easy and aesthetic visualization
of large datasets (and small as well). Data features can be represented on plots as a position, size/thickness and color of markers
of several basic shapes, finished with a photorealistic lighting and depth of field.

No need to write shaders, intersection algorithms, handle 3D scene technicalities. Basic usage is even more simple than with
`matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`__:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from plotoptix import TkOptiX

   n = 1000000                                  # 1M points, better not try this with matplotlib
   xyz = 3 * (np.random.random((n, 3)) - 0.5)   # random 3D positions
   r = 0.02 * np.random.random(n) + 0.002       # random radii

   plot = TkOptiX()
   plot.set_data("my plot", xyz, r=r)
   plot.show()

... but PlotOptiX is much faster on large data and, with all the raytraced shades and DoF, more readable and eye catching.

PlotOptiX is based on `NVIDIA OptiX <https://developer.nvidia.com/optix>`_ framework wrapped in RnD.SharpOptiX C#/C++ libraries and CUDA
shaders by R&D Team. PlotOptiX makes use of RTX-capable GPU's. In this early version we start with:

Features
--------

- progressive path tracing with explicit light sampling
- pinhole cameras and cameras with depth of field simulation
- geometries: particle (sphere), parallelepiped, parallelogram, tetrahedron, bezier line, surface mesh
- flat, diffuse, specular and glass shading
- spherical and parallelogram light sources
- environmental light and ambient occlusion
- post-processing: tonal correction curves, levels adjustment, mask overlay
- GPU acceleration using RT Cores, and everything else what comes with `OptiX 6.0 <https://developer.nvidia.com/optix>`__
- callbacks at the scene initialization, start and end of each frame raytracing, end of progressive accumulation
- image output to `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`__ array
- Tkinter based UI or headless raytracer

System Requirements
-------------------

- operating system, *currently*: Windows
- `.NET Framework <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework>`__ >= 4.6.1 (but you should already have it)
- a `CUDA-enabled GPU <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus>`__ with compute capability 5.0 (Maxwell) to latest
- `CUDA Toolkit v10.1 <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`__
- Python 3 **64-bit**

What's Included
---------------

- OptiX 6.0.0 libraries
- RnD.SharpOptiX and RnD.SharpEncoder libraries
- all other required 3'rd party libraries: FFmpeg, LibTiff, Newtonsoft.Json
- Python examples

Installation
============

**Note**, at this point, PlotOptiX binaries are prepared for Windows only. We should be able to extend also to Linux,
but today you are dealing with the very early version of the project.

**.NET Framework**

Most likely you already got the right version with your Windows installation. Just in case, here is the command verifying this::

   C:\reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\full" /v version
   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\full
       version    REG_SZ    4.7.03056

If the number in your output is < 4.6.1, visit `download page <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework>`__ and
install the most recent release.

**CUDA Toolkit**

CUDA libraries are not included in the package. They are rather huge, and the installation is quite straight-forward. Simply visit
`CUDA download page <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`__, select your operating system and CUDA version **10.1** (we
keep binaries compatible with the latest CUDA release). Download and run the installer.

Make sure the CUDA_PATH environment variable is configured::

   C:\>echo %CUDA_PATH%
   C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.1

It is also a good idea to keep your GPU driver up to date.

**PlotOptiX**

Using pip::

   pip install plotoptix

From GitHub sources::

   git clone https://github.com/rnd-team-dev/plotoptix.git
   cd plotoptix
   python setup.py install

Then, try running code from the top of this readme, or one of the examples.

Development path
----------------

This is an early, beta version, with binaries released for Windows only. Everything what is implemented should work, but there are
some important features not available yet, eg. AI denoiser or even ticks and labels on plot axes.

PlotOptiX is basically an interface to RnD.SharpOptiX library which we are developing and using in our Studio. RnD.SharpOptiX offers
much more functionality than it is now available through PlotOptiX. Eg. live streaming of the raytraced video output. We'll progressively
add more to PlotOptiX if there is interest in this project (download, star, and
`donate <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RG47ZEL5GKLNA&source=url>`__ if you like it!).

The idea for development is:

1. Binaries for Linux.
2. Complete the plot layout / cover more raytracing features.
3. Convenience functions for various plot styles. Other GUI's.

   *Here, the community input is possible and warmly welcome!*

Examples

Looking at examples is the best way to get started and explore PlotOptiX features. Have a look at the
`readme and sample codes here <https://github.com/rnd-team-dev/plotoptix/tree/master/examples>`__.
