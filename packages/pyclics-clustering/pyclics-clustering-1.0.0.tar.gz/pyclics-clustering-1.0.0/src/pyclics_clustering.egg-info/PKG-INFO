        ## Connected Components
        
        As implemented in the [`networkx` package](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.components.connected.connected_components.html).
        
        
        ## Hierarchical Link Clustering (HLC)
        
        The algorithm is described in
        
        > Ahn YY, Bagrow JP and Lehmann S: Link communities reveal multiscale complexity in networks. *Nature* **466**, 761 (2010).
        
        The implementation is copied from [TamÃ¡s Nepusz](https://github.com/ntamas/hlc) with
        slight modifications to work with CLICS networks.
        
        
        ## Louvain Community Detection
        
        The algorithm is described in
        
        > Vincent D Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte, Renaud Lefebvre: Fast unfolding of communities in large networks. *Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment* **10** (2008), P10008 (12pp).
        
        We use the implementation by [Thomas Aynaud](https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain).
        
        
        ## Label Propagation
        
        The algorithm is described in
        
        > Cordasco, G., & Gargano, L.: Community detection via semi-synchronous label propagation algorithms. 
        > In Business Applications of Social Network Analysis (BASNA), 
        > 2010 IEEE International Workshop on (pp. 1-8). IEEE.
        
        As implemented in the [`networkx` package](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.community.label_propagation.label_propagation_communities.html).
