## Install

Also install requests (until I figure out how to make it automatically include this)
```
pip install requests
```

```python
from blockstream import blockexplorer

# get transaction by id
tx_id = '56a5b477182cddb6edb460b39135a3dc785eaf7ea88a572052a761d6983e26a2'
tx = blockexplorer.get_transaction(tx_id)

# get address data
address = '1Bgut7QkwZS6pGyCi6CHeFkNN4Z5DzGP7P'
addr_info = blockexplorer.get_address(address)
