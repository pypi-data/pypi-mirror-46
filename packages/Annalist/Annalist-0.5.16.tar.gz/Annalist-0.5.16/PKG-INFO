        Goals
        -----
        
        The overall goal of Annalist is to make it easy for individuals and small teams to create and explore linked data on the web, without requiring software development.
        
        * Easy data: out-of-box data acquisition, modification and organization of small data records.
        * Flexible data: new record types and fields can be added as-required.
        * Sharable data: use textual, easy to read file formats that can be shared by web, email, file transfer, version management system, memory stick, etc.
        * Remixable data: records that can be first class participants in a wider ecosystem of linked data, with links in and links out.
