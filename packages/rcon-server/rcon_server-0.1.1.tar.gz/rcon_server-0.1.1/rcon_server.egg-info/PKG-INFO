Description: # rcon-server
        A implementation of the RCON protocol on the server side.
        
        # Why do you need an RCON server implementation?
        
        rcon-server is primarily designed as a tool for testing, e.g. with unit tests.
        Installing, running, updating, etc a regular srcds server might use a lot of
        resources.
        \>10GB of storage space per server is not uncommon.
        Also it is hard to get some results from an server in a test environment.
        A server only reports the amount of users which are on the server.
        Getting several people on a server for testing is pretty annoying and time
        consuming.
        rcon-server allows you to implement a function that returns an answer per
        command.
