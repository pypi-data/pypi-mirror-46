        Many features inspired by Django, but modified to be more general for use outside of web applications.
        
        PyApp wit the release of 4.0 supports Python 3.6+ all previous versions are no longer supported.
        This change allows for the user of F-Strings, and removal of any compatibility code.
        
        So what do we handle?
        =====================
        
        - Configuration - Loading, merging your settings from different sources
          + Python modules
          + Files and HTTP(s) endpoints for JSON and YAML files.
        - Instance Factories - Configuration of plugins, database connections, or just implementations of an ``ABC``.
          Leveraging settings to make setup of your application easy and reduce coupling.
        - Checks - A framework for checking your settings are correct, can the application connect to that API end point?
        - Application - Provides a extensible and simple CLI interface for adding more commands, comes with commands to support Checks, settings.
        
        Coming soon
        -----------
        
        Support for common services eg email, as well as companion libraries to add plugin factories for SQL Alchemy, Redis, Paramiko, LDAP etc.
