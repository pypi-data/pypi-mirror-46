# Darkdetect

This package allows to detect if macOS 10.14+ is running with the [Dark Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208976) enabled. The main application of this package is to detect the Dark mode from your GUI Python application (Tkinter/wx/pyqt/qt for python (pyside)/...) and apply the needed adjustments to your interface. Darkdetect is particularly useful if your GUI library **does not** provide a public API for this detection (I am looking at you, Qt). In addition, this package does not depend on other modules or packages that are not already included in standard Python distributions.

## Usage

```
import darkdetect

>>> darkdetect.theme()
'Dark'

>>> darkdetect.isDark()
True

>>> darkdetect.isLight()
False
```
It's that easy.

## Install

The preferred channel is PyPI:
```
pip install darkdetect
```

Alternatively, you are free to vendor directly a copy of Darkdetect in your app. Further information on vendoring can be found [here](https://medium.com/underdog-io-engineering/vendoring-python-dependencies-with-pip-b9eb6078b9c0).

## Notes

- This software is licensed under the terms of the 3-clause BSD License.
- This package can be installed on any operative system, but it will always return `None` unless executed on macOS 10.14 Mojave or newer versions. This package is designed to work also with older versions of macOS and in those cases it will also return `None`. Detection of the dark menu bar and dock option (available from 10.10) is not supported.
