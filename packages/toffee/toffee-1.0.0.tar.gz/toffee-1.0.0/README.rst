Toffee: Test Object Factory Fixtures
====================================

Toffee creates factories for your model fixtures::

    from toffee import Fixture, Factory

    product_factory = Factory(Product, id=Seq())


    class MyFixture(Fixture):
        product_1 = product_factory(desc='cuddly toy')
        product_2 = product_factory(desc='toy tractor')
        user = Factory(User, username='fred')
        order = Factory(Order, user=user, products=[product_1, product_2])


    def test_product_search():
	with MyFixture() as f:
          assert f.product_1 in search_products('toy')
          assert f.product_2 in search_products('toy')


Toffee is similar in scope to
`factory_boy <https://github.com/dnerdy/factory_boy>`_.
The differences that prompted me to write a new library are:

- Toffee promotes working with on fixtures as groups of objects to be created
  and destroyed as a unit, rather than individual factories
- Explicit support for setup/teardown of fixtures
