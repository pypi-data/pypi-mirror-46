Description: # STKHelper
        
        STKHelper is a Python package for creating and running STK Simulations using their interface.
        
        ## Installation
        
        STKHelper is on the [Python Packaging Index](https://pypi.org/project/stkhelper/). Thus, use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install STKHelper.
        
        ```bash
        pip install stkhelper
        ```
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        STKHelper currently only work on Windows platforms. Along with this, you will need [STK](https://agi.com/products) downloaded and running on your computer using a purchased license. This will not work with the free version of STK because the free version does not have access to the Interface.
        
        ## Modules
        
        STKHelper currently offers three different modules to aid in calculations.
        
        ### application.py
        
        ```python
        from stkhelper import application
        
        app = application.Application()
        ```
        
        This module contains the `Application` class, which is the class used to create applications and scenarios in STK. It stores all area target and satellite information for the scenario while also manages the current running application, scenario, and root.
        
        ### processing.py
        
        ```python
        from stkhelper import processing
        
        processing.Processing.PrintSatellites(satelliteArray)
        ```
        ```bash
        Satellite:		15
        Satellite Name:		ISS
        Satellite Pointer:	<pointerToObject>
        ```
        
        This module contains the `Processing` class, which is a static class containing static methods used for processing data, problem solving, or clear display.
        
        ### tle_manager.py
        
        ```python
        from stkhelper import tle_manager
        
        parsedTLE = tle_manager.TLE_Manager.ParseTLE('TestTLE.txt')
        ```
        
        This module contains the `TLE_Manager` class, which is a static class containing static methods used for handling, processing, retrieving, and parsing TLE files. Currently, the module only supports parsing a TLE, but will eventually be able to retrieve a TLE from STK's server.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from stkhelper import application
        
        app = application.Application()
        app.AddScenario('Test Scenario','+24hr')
        
        app.CloseScenario()
        app.CloseApplication()
        ```
