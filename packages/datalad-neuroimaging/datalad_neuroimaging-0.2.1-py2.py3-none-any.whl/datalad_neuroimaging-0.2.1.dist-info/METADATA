extension), please see the `DataLad website <http://datalad.org>`__ or
the `main GitHub project page <http://datalad.org>`__.

Installation
------------

Before you install this package, please make sure that you `install a
recent version of
git-annex <https://git-annex.branchable.com/install>`__. Afterwards,
install the latest version of ``datalad-neuroimaging`` from
`PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/datalad-neuroimaging>`__. It is
recommended to use a dedicated
`virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__:

::

   # create and enter a new virtual environment (optional)
   virtualenv --system-site-packages --python=python3 ~/env/dataladni
   . ~/env/dataladni/bin/activate

   # install from PyPi
   pip install datalad_neuroimaging

There is also a `Singularity container <http://singularity.lbl.gov>`__
available. The latest release version can be obtained by running:

::

   singularity pull shub://datalad/datalad-neuroimaging
