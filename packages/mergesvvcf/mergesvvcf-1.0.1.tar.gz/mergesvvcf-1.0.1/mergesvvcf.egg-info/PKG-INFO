Description: # Merge SV VCFs
        
        
        This set of routines merges SV VCF files by calls, labeling calls by the callers that
        made them in an INFO field, Callers=.   Most of the work goes into normalizing
        SV calls, which are treated as paired of breakpoints that are equal if they fall within
        a user-specified window.
