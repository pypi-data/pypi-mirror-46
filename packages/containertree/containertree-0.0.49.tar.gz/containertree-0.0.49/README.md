This is a library that demonstrates different methods to build container trees. 
Across different kinds of trees, we generate a [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) 
to represent a file or container hierarchy. We can either generate 
[trees](https://singularityhub.github.io/container-tree/examples/files_tree/demo/), 
or [comparison matrices](https://singularityhub.github.io/container-tree/examples/heatmap/demo/) 
using them! Learn more by reading the documentation, or follow links to related tools below.

If you want to jump in, check out how to create a [Container File Tree](https://singularityhub.github.io/container-tree/pages/demo/tree/) as shown [here](https://vsoch.github.io/containertree).

# Visualizations

These are under development! Here are some quick examples:

 - [Files Tree](https://singularityhub.github.io/container-tree/pages/demo/files_tree/)
 - [Shub Tree](https://singularityhub.github.io/container-tree/pages/demo/shub_tree/)
 - [Heatmap](https://singularityhub.github.io/container-tree/pages/demo/heatmap/)


# Github Actions

If you want to deploy a container tree to Github pages alongside your Dockerfile,
meaning that you can add and update a visualization on every change to your
repository, see [vsoch/containertree](https://www.github.com/vsoch/containertree)
and the tree it deploys [here](https://vsoch.github.io/containertree). The
[Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile) in the subfolder here is the driver to 
do the extraction. To read a writeup of the work, see 
[this post](https://vsoch.github.io/2019/github-deploy/).


The examples and their generation are provided in each of the subfolders of the [examples](examples) directory.
