## Installation

See [releases] for installation instructions

[releases]: https://github.com/AshtonUPS/Py-MI-PS/releases

## Usage

Invoke PyMips with the pymips command from you python virtual environment:

```sh
pymips <path to mips file>
```

## Current Features

Currently, only base mips commands are supported. Some pseudo commands will work, but they are unreliable and may not parse properly. No commands that take advantage of coprocessors are supported.
