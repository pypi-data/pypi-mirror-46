Description: 
                  'cuttlery' is a package for determining the codon usage table of input
                  sequences. Instead of calculating an absolute codon usage frequency
                  for all observed genes as other packages do, cuttlery handles codon
                  usage frequency as a distribution for each codon. The cuttlery package
                  also contains tools for plotting codon usage information, calculating
                  if an unknown ORF is likely to belong to coding or noncoding sequence,
                  calculating nucleotide diversity of protein alignments and plotting
                  the results, as well as looking for synonymous and nonsynonymous
                  mutation heterogeneity in protein alignments.
