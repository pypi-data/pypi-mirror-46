'cuttlery' is a package for determining the codon usage table of input
sequences. Instead of calculating an absolute codon usage frequency
for all observed genes as other packages do, cuttlery handles codon
usage frequency as a distribution for each codon. The cuttlery package
also contains tools for plotting codon usage information, calculating
if an unknown ORF is likely to belong to coding or noncoding sequence,
calculating nucleotide diversity of protein alignments and plotting
the results, as well as looking for synonymous and nonsynonymous
mutation heterogeneity in protein alignments.
