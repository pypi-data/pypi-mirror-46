Description: # bentso
        
        A library to process ENTSO-E electricity data for use in industrial ecology and life cycle assessment. Developed as part of the [BONSAI](https://bonsai.uno/) network.

        ## Example living life cycle inventory model
        
        Living life cycle inventory models can:
        
        * Automatically update themselves
        * Provide results on multiple spatial scales
        * Provide results on multiple time scales
        
        This particular model is quite simple - we will gather the necessary data from the [ENTSO-E API](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/hackathon-2019),
        and return it in the specified RDF format. The model should support the following capabilities:
        
        * Be able to specify what kind of input parameters it accepts
        * Validate inputs and return sensible error messages
        * Cache data to avoid unncessary ENTSO-E API calls
        * Function both as a command-line utility and a normal Python library
        
        Inputs can be a list of countries (default is all countries in ENTSO-E), and a time period (default is a given year - maybe 2018?).
        
        This model should also follow the [BONSAI Python library skeleton](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/python-skeleton).
