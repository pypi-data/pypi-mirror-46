The [Neurophox module](https://solgaard-lab-neurophox.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/) is an open source machine learning and photonic simulation framework based on unitary mesh networks presented in [arxiv/1808.00458](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00458.pdf) and [arxiv/1903.04579](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04579.pdf).

## Motivation

Orthogonal and unitary neural networks have interesting properties and have been studied for synthetic natural language processing tasks (see [unitary mesh-based RNN](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/jing17a/jing17a.pdf), [unitary evolution RNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06464.pdf), and [orthogonal evolution RNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06662.pdf)). Furthermore, new energy-efficient photonic technologies are being built to realize unitary mesh-based neural networks using light as the computing medium as opposed to conventional analog electronics.

## Introduction

Neurophox provides a robust and general framework for mesh network layers in orthogonal and unitary neural networks. We use an efficient definition for any feedforward mesh architecture, `neurophox.meshmodel.MeshModel`, to develop mesh layer architectures in Numpy (`neurophox.numpy.layers`), Tensorflow 2 (`neurophox.tensorflow.layers`), and (soon) PyTorch.

Scattering matrix models used in unitary mesh networks for photonics simulations are provided in `neurophox.components`. The models for all layers are fully defined in `neurophox.meshmodel`, which provides a general framework for efficient implementation of any feedforward unitary mesh network.

## Dependencies and requirements

Some important requirements for Neurophox are:
1. Python >=3.6
2. Tensorflow >=2.0.0a
3. PyTorch

The dependencies for Neurophox (specified in `requirements.txt`) are:
```text
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
tensorflow>=2.0.0a
torch>=1.1
```

## Getting started

### Installation

There are currently two options to install Neurophox:
1. Installation via `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install neurophox
    ```
2. Installation from source via `pip`:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/solgaardlab/neurophox
    pip install -e neurophox
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
If installing other dependencies manually, ensure you install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (since PyTorch mesh layers are currently in development) and [Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf).

#### Using the GPU

If using a GPU, we recommend using a `conda` environement to install GPU dependencies using CUDA 10.0 with the following commands:
```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-alpha0
```

### Imports

```python
import numpy as np
from neurophox.numpy import RMNumpy
from neurophox.tensorflow import RM

N = 16

tf_layer = RM(N)
np_layer = RMNumpy(N, phases=tf_layer.phases)

np.allclose(tf_layer.matrix, np_layer.matrix)  # True
np.allclose(tf_layer(np.eye(N)), np_layer.matrix)  # True
```

### Inspection

We can inspect the parameters for each layer using `neurophox.control.MeshPhases` which can be accessed via `tf_layer.phases` and `np_layer.phases`.


We can inspect the matrix elements implemented by each layer as follows via `tf_layer.matrix` and `np_layer.matrix`.

### Phase shift settings visualization
The phase shift patterns used to generate the above propagation patterns can also be visualized by plotting `np_layer.phases`:

### Light propagation visualization

For the phase shift settings above, we can visualize the propagation of light (field magnitude), as the data "flows" through the mesh.

### Small machine learning example

It is possible to compose Neurophox Tensorflow layers into unitary neural networks using `tf.keras.Sequential`
to solve machine learning problems. Here we use absolute value nonlinearities and categorical cross entropy.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from neurophox.tensorflow import RM
from neurophox.ml.nonlinearities import cnorm, cnormsq

ring_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    RM(3, activation=tf.keras.layers.Activation(cnorm)),
    RM(3, activation=tf.keras.layers.Activation(cnorm)),
    RM(3, activation=tf.keras.layers.Activation(cnorm)),
    RM(3, activation=tf.keras.layers.Activation(cnorm)),
    tf.keras.layers.Activation(cnormsq),
    tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: tf.math.real(x[:, :2])), # get first 2 output ports (we already know it is real from the activation),
    tf.keras.layers.Activation('softmax')
])

ring_model.compile(
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=0.0025)
)
```

Below is a visualization for many planar classification problems:
