            pip install arche
        
        Arche (pronounced as Arkey) helps to verify data using set of defined rules, for example:
          * Validation with JSON schema
          * Coverage
          * Duplicates
          * Garbage symbols
          * Comparison of two jobs
          
        _We use it in Scrapinghub to ensure quality of scraped data_
        
        ## Installation
        
        Arche requires [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) environment, supporting both [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab#installation) and [Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) UI
        
        For JupyterLab, you will need to properly install [plotly extensions](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py#jupyterlab-support-python-35)
        
        Then just `pip install arche`
        
        ## Use case
        * You need to check the quality of data from Scrapy Cloud jobs continuously.
        
          Say, you scraped some website and have the data ready in the cloud. A typical approach would be:
            * Create a JSON schema and validate the data with it
            * Use the created schema in [Spidermon Validation](https://spidermon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/item-validation.html#with-json-schema)
        * You want to use it in your application to verify Scrapy Cloud data
        
        ## Developer Setup
        
        	pipenv install --dev
        	pipenv shell
        	tox

        - *Fields Counts* renamed to *Coverage Difference* and results in 2 bar plots, #9, #51:
           * *Coverage from job stats fields counts* which reflects coverage for each field for both jobs
           * *Coverage difference more than 5%* which prints >5% difference between the coverages (was ratio difference before)
        - *Compare Scraped Categories* renamed to *Category Coverage Difference* and results in 2 bar plots for each category, #52:
           * *Coverage for `field`* which reflects value counts (categories) coverage for the field for both jobs
           * *Coverage difference more than 10% for `field`* which shows >10% differences between the category coverages

        arche.rules.duplicates.find_by(df, ["title", "category"]).show()
        ```
        - `basic_json_schema().json()` prints a schema in JSON format
        - `Result.show()` to print a rule result, e.g.
        ```
        from arche.rules.garbage_symbols import garbage_symbols
        from arche.readers.items import JobItems
        items = JobItems(0, "235801/1/15")
