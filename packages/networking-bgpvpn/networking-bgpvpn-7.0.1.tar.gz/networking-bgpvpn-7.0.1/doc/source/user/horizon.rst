General information
===================

Networking-bgpvpn contains the bgpvpn_dashboard plugin for Horizon.
It adds a BGPVPN Interconnections panel in the admin section. Admin users can
handle BGPVPNs resources through this panel.
The operations possible for admin users are:

* listing BGPVPN
* creating a BGPVPN
* editing a BGPVPN
* associating or disassociating a BGPVPN to network(s)
* associating or disassociating a BGPVPN to router(s)
* deleting a BGPVPN

For non admin users the plugin adds a BGPVPN Interconnections panel in the Project
section under the Network subsection.
The operations possible for non admin users are:

* listing BGPVPN (display only name, type, networks and routers associations)
* editing a BGPVPN (only the name)
* associating or disassociating a BGPVPN to network(s)
* associating or disassociating a BGPVPN to router(s)

Installation and Configuration
==============================

Devstack will automatically configure Horizon to enable the Horizon plugin.

For others deployments we assume that Horizon and networking-bgpvpn are already
installed. Their installation folders are respectively <horizon> and
<networking-bgpvpn>.


Copy configuration file:

.. code-block:: shell

   cp <networking-bgpvpn>/bgpvpn_dashboard/enabled/_[0-9]*.py <horizon>/openstack_dashboard/local/enabled/

Restart the web server hosting Horizon.

The BGPVPN Interconnections panels will now be in your Horizon dashboard.
