Contributing to Wellspring
==========================

Welcome!
--------

First of all, welcome to Wellspring and thank you for your interest in
contributing to our project!

Feel free to read the following sections in order to have a better
understanding of how you can contribute to Wellspring and do not
hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Wellspring is an open source project and we are excited to receive
contributions from our community!

Following these guidelines will help you add value to our project as
well as keep you on the right track regarding latest versions, sources,
code formatting as well as documentation.

Furthermore, this will also make the job easier for the developers when
addressing issues, assessing changes or helping you finalize your
requests!

Having a fresh perspective from you is an amazing way to improve our
project and to make it bigger and better than ever. There are many ways
that you can contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving
the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or
writing code which can be incorporated into Wellspring.

Ground rules for a perfect collaboration
========================================

This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful,
considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of
testing, project dependencies, etc). Mention and link to your code of
conduct, if you have one.

Responsibilities \* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change
that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux. \* Check for
overlap with other PRs. \* Discuss things transparently and get
community feedback. \* Being respectful and considerate to others is a
must-have. \* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new
contributors from all backgrounds. See the `Python Community Code of
Conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`__.

First Steps
===========

If you want to help out with Wellspring development, there are a few
things you need to do first! \* Make sure you have a functional Gitlab
account \* Install Visual Studio Code and connect to your Gitlab branch
\* Write your code/changes to code in your own branch, save changes and
once done, issue a request to merge

**Newbie? No worries!**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free*
guide, `How to Contribute to an Open Source Project for
Newbies <http://www.firsttimersonly.com/>`__.

Feeling ready to make your first changes yet? It's alright if you are
still unsure of some things, feel free to ask for help; everyone is a
beginner at first!

Getting started
===============

**Quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to
include:

-  Let them know if they need to sign a CLA, agree to a DCO, or get any
   other legal stuff out of the way
-  If tests are required for contributions, let them know, and explain
   how to run the tests
-  If you use anything other than GitHub to manage issues (ex. JIRA or
   Trac), let them know which tools theyâ€™ll need to contribute

**For bigger contributions**

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Make the changes in your fork/branch
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:

   -  Be sure you have followed the code style and language for the
      project.
   -  Check the document for any mistakes in the code
   -  Save your version and issue a request to merge

**For small fixes**

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is
small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be
submitted by a contributor as a discussion on the *Microsoft Teams
Henkel Group*.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce
any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does
not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following: \*
Spelling / grammar fixes \* Typo correction, white space and formatting
changes \* Comment clean up \* Bug fixes that change default return
values or error codes stored in constants \* Adding logging messages or
debugging output \* Moving source files from one directory or package to
another

How to report a bug
===================

Any security issues should be submitted directly to
wellspring@henkel.com. In order to determine whether you are dealing
with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions: \* Can I access
something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to? \*
Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're
probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer
"no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue,
so if you're unsure, just email us at wellspring@henkel.com.

General questions should go on the Microsoft Teams Henkel group. The
gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped
over a bug.

How to suggest a feature or enhancement
=======================================

If you find yourself wishing for a feature or enhancement that doesn't
exist in Wellspring, you are probably not the only one thinking so! Many
of the changes and additions to Wellspring have been added because our
users saw the need for them. You can start a discussion on the Henkel
Group on Microsoft Teams and describe the features and enhancements you
think Wellspring could use! The developers will see your idea and will
shortly discuss with you the possibility of potential changes.

Code review process
===================

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis and reevaluates
them. After feedback has been given we expect responses as fast as
possible. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't
showing any activity.

Community
=========

You can chat with the core team on Henkel Microsoft Teams Group. There
you can ask questions and check the on-going discussions regarding
different topics and projects.

Contributing
============

Pull Request Process
--------------------

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end
   of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md
   to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. Once you are done you can create a Pull Request which will
