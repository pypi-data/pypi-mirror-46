PyGreSQL - Python interface for PostgreSQL
==========================================

PyGreSQL is a Python module that interfaces to a PostgreSQL database.
It embeds the PostgreSQL query library to allow easy use of the powerful
PostgreSQL features from a Python script.

PyGreSQL is developed and tested on a NetBSD system, but it should also
run on most other platforms where PostgreSQL and Python is running.
It is based on the PyGres95 code written by Pascal Andre.
D'Arcy (darcy@druid.net) renamed it to PyGreSQL starting with version 2.0
and serves as the "BDFL" of PyGreSQL.
