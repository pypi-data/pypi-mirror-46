Description: # Teichicrypt
        Is a python program for encrypting and decrypting files of any kind. It is **not** based on any other crypting mechanism I know.
        ## Requirements
        Python ver >= 3.6m, mpmath
        ## Usage
        Either run the pythonfile with python version 3.6 or greater or import it into a other script wich is running python version >= 3.6.  
        When run as main, a tkinter window for easy usage will open, else use the subroutines as you want.
        ## To-do
          * Good documentation
          * implementation as command-line tool
          * ...
