Description: ## Home
        Built on popular scientific computing toolkits, aresy aims to make it easy to process large-scale data on a single server. aresy treats the whole data flow as a computation graph, where the input data will be put into placeholders, and you can perform nearly any python-based transformation by extending the graph. aresy was designed with the following principles:
        
        - Compatible with python data science ecosystem, such as numpy, pytorch, tensorflow modules.
        - Able to process cross-type, cross-domain, cross-granularity data simultaneously.
        - Easy to build a large feature generator, a transformer or even a data loader to feed preprocessed data into deep learning models.
        
        ## Installation
        ```shell
        python setup.py install
        ```
