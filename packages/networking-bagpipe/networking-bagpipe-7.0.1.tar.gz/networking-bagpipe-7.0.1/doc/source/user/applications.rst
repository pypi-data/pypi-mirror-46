Applications
============

----------
Neutron L2
----------

.. Note:: This application is distinct from the use of BaGPipe to create
   BGPVPN interconnections in the context of the BGPVPN Interconnection API
   (see below).

The ``bagpipe`` mechanism driver for Neutron's ML2 core plugin, when enabled
along with the corresponding compute node agent extension, will result in
Neutron tenant networks to be realized with E-VPN.

How it works is that ``bagpipe`` ML2 driver will allocate a BGP VPN identifier
(called a BGP "Route Target") for each Neutron tenant network, and the
``bagpipe`` agent extension on compute node will exchange messages (typically
via RabbitMQ) with Neutron server to setup a corresponding E-VPN instance with
this identifier on the local :ref:`bagpipe-bgp` instance on the compute node and
attach ports to this instance as needed.

.. blockdiag:: ml2.blockdiag

This solution is currently supported with the linux networking stack (i.e. with
the linuxbridge agent enabled with bagpipe extension, and :ref:`bagpipe-bgp` driver
for the linux bridge VXLAN implementation).  The approach would be easily
extended to support OpenVSwitch as well.

Another wait to understand this approach for someone coming with a Neutron ML2
background is that it is similar to the l2pop behavior except that the bridge
forwarding entries are populated based on BGP VPN routes rather than based on
RPCs. This similarity comes with a difference: while l2pop announces the
information on one messaging topic, each compute node receiving information
about all Neutron networks even the ones not present on its vswitch, the
behavior with BaGPipe ML2 is that a compute node will only receive the
mappings that it needs.

Neutron BGPVPN Interconnection
------------------------------

.. Note:: This application is distinct from the use of BaGPipe to realize
   Neutron networks with BGP E-VPNs, and ``bagpipe`` driver for
   networking-bgpvpn_ does not rely on ``bagpipe`` ML2 mechanism driver.

This application of networking-bagpipe aims at proposing a lightweight
implementation of the BGPVPN service plugin, designed to work with the ML2
``openvswitch`` mechanism driver (or as an alternative with the ``bagpipe``
ML2 mechanism driver).

When used along with the ``openvswitch`` ML2 mechanism driver, it involves:

* ``bagpipe`` driver for the BGPVPN service plugin (networking-bgpvpn_ package)

* ``bagpipe_bgpvpn`` extension for the OpenVSwitch compute node agent
  (from this package)

* :ref:`bagpipe-bgp` lightweight BGP VPN implementation

.. blockdiag:: bgpvpn.blockdiag

Work in progress and future applications
----------------------------------------

Work in progress:

* networking-l2gw driver leveraging bagpipe-bgp running on a ToR

* networking-sfc driver, leveraging bagpipe-bgp similarly as in
  draft-ietf-bess-service-chaining_

* BaGPipe ML2 with openvswitch agent

* BaGPipe BGPVPN driver with linuxbridge mechanism driver and agent

Considered:

* L3 plugin for inter-subnet distributed routing
