# ColorCode

Generation of multicolored 2D codes

This Python app/library will generate several 2D codes and aggregate them
into one single image using varying interleaving algorithms.
The result is, for instance, an image with one code on each color channel.

Currently, only Aztec code is implemented, but the program will auto-load
code generators placed in the package folder.
