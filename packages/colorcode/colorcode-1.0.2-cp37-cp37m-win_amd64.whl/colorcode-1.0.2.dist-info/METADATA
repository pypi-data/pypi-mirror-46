ColorCode
=========

A library that creates multi-colored Aztec codes.
They are actually multiple Aztec codes, merged into a single image.
Usually they are each on a separate color channel.

Command line tool
-----------------

This package comes with the `colorcode` command, that creates a color code.

For instance:

.. code-block:: bash

    colorcode "Hello World" "Python 3 RuleZ" "Let's go Aztec"

Will create a code with data ``Hello World``, ``Python 3 RuleZ`` and ``Let's go Aztec``.
Each data string must be surrounded by quotes if you run the command from a shell,
because each parameter to the command becomes a separate data set.

You can override default settings with various parameters:

.. code-block:: bash

    colorcode -o mycode.png -m 4 -i redcyan "Hello World" "Python 3 RuleZ"

- ``-o mycode.png`` means "Save the image to the file ``mycode.png``"
- ``-m 4`` means "Each square block (aka module) will have a size of 4x4 pixels"
- ``-i redcyan`` means "Use the Red/Cyan method to combine the codes instead of the default"

By default the combination method is chosen automatically depending on the number of data entries.

There are more parameters, you can find them out with ``--help`` as usual.

You can also run the command as a Python module: ``python3 -m colorcode``.

About the project
-----------------

Don't expect the project to be improved or maintained in the future.
This was mostly a learning project for me, to learn about Cython, Sphinx docs,
Python packagaing and Aztec codes.

It works, and it's fun, so I share it. But it's currently mostly useless.
There is no app to decode the codes and I don't plan to make one.

Anyway, I hope you will find this project interesting and inspiring.
