Description: ==============================================================================
        collective.relatedslider
        ==============================================================================
        
        This is a Plone addon that adds a behavior and viewlet for displaying related
        content in a scrollable HTML/CSS slider at the bottom of the content area.  It
        can use either the relatedItems behavior or collection behavior applied to the
        content for determining the related items.
        
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install collective.relatedslider by adding it to your buildout::
        
           [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                collective.relatedslider
        
        
        and then running "bin/buildout"
        
        Install the add-on from the add-ons control panel, and then use the "Dexterity
        Types" control panel to add the "Related Slider" behavior to your types.  Any
        types using this behavior will also need to have either the "Related Items"
        behavior or the "Collection" behavior applied as well.
        
        When editing content with the behavior applied you should see a drop down to
        select where the slider items come from (either collection criteria or related
        items, depending on the applied behaviors).  If you use Related Items as the
        source for slider items, the normal related items viewlet will be hidden from
        view.
