Description: 
        pracmln -- Markov logic networks in Python
        ==========================================
        
        pracmln is a toolbox for statistical relational learning and reasoning and provides a pure python implementation of Markov logic networks. pracmln is a statistical relational learning and reasoning system that supports efficient learning and inference in relational domains. pracmln has started as a fork of the ProbCog toolbox and has been extended by latest developments in learning and reasoning by the Institute for Artificial Intelligence  at the University of Bremen, Germany.

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        pracmln comes with its own sphinx-based documentation. To build it, conduct the following actions:
        
            $ cd path/to/pracmln/doc
            $ make html
        
        If you have installed Sphinx, the documentation should be build. Open
        it in your favorite web browser:
        
            $ firefox _build/html/index.html
        
        Sphinx can be installed with
        
            $ sudo pip install sphinx sphinxcontrib-bibtex
