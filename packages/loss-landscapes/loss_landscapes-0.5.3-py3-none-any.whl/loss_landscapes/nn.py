def random_line(start_model, evaluation_f, distance=1, steps=100, normalization=None) -> np.ndarray:
    """
        Returns an approximation of the loss of the model along a linear subspace of the
        parameter space defined by a start point and a randomly sampled direction.

        That is, given a neural network model, whose parameters define a point in parameter
        space, and a distance, the loss is computed at 'steps' points along a random
        direction, from the start point up to the maximum distance from the start point.

        Note that the dimensionality of the model parameters has an impact on the expected
        length of a uniformly sampled vector in parameter space. That is, the more parameters
        a model has, the longer the distance in the random vector's direction should be,
        in order to see meaningful change in individual parameters. Normalizing the
        direction vector according to the model's current parameter values, which is supported
        through the 'normalization' parameter, helps reduce the impact of the distance
        parameter. In future releases, the distance parameter will refer to the maximum change
        in an individual parameter, rather than the length of the random direction vector.

        Note also that a simple line approximation can produce misleading views
        of the loss landscape due to the scale invariance of neural networks. The sharpness or
        flatness of minima or maxima is affected by the scale of the neural network weights.
        For more details, see `https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913v3`. It is recommended to
        normalize the direction, preferably with the 'filter' option.

        The evaluation function supplied has to be of the form

            evaluation_function(model)

        and must specify a procedure whereby the model passed to it is evaluated on the
        task of interest, returning the resulting loss.

        along the straight line connecting the two vertices. A common choice is to
        use the weights before training and the weights after convergence as the start

        paramater space from the initialization to some minima. There is no guarantee
