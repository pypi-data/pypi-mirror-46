        Data wrangling and processing of geospatial data should be seamless 
        so that earth scientists can focus on science. 
        
        The purpose of PODPAC is to facilitate:
        
         * Access of data products
         * Subsetting of data products
         * Projecting and interpolating data products
         * Combining/compositing data products
         * Analysis of data products
         * Sharing of algorithms and data products
         * Use of cloud computing architectures (AWS) for processing
         
        ## Installation
        
        For installation instructions, see [install.md](doc/source/install.md). 
        
        ## Documentation
        
        The official PODPAC documentation is available here: [https://podpac.org](https://podpac.org)
        
        For usage examples, see the [podpac-examples](https://github.com/creare-com/podpac_examples) repository.

        ## Stability / Maturity
        
        This is in the early development phase. As such:
        
        * The code may be refactored drastically
        * Interfaces may change in a backwards-incompatible ways
        * Modules, Functions and classes may change names or disappear altogether
        * The above may happen without notice
        * Documentation and testing may be lacking
        
        We are working towards stability so that the above would no longer be true, and we have already made significant strides towards a stable, maintainable library. 
        
        As such use PODPAC at your own risk.
