# COBRA Tools

An assortment of tools used by COBRA Lab for bioinformatics.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Requires Python 3.6 or later. All other requirements are included in `requirements.txt`

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Unit testing

Run unit tests with 

    cd general
    pytest -sv --cov-report term-missing --cov=models

### Linting

Lint with

    cd general
