====================
Account Accrual Base
====================

This module contains objets, fields and menu entries that are used by other
accrual modules. So you need to install other accrual modules to get the
additionnal functionalities:

* the module 'account_cutoff_accrual_picking' will manage accrued expenses and
  revenues based on pickings.
* a not-developped-yet module will manage accrued expenses and revenues based
  on timesheets.

Please contact Alexis de Lattre from Akretion <alexis.delattre@akretion.com>
