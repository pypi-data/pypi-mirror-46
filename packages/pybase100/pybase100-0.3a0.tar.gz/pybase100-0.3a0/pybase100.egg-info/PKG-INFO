        A huge thanks to Adam Niederer for his original Base100 version written in Rust: https://github.com/AdamNiederer/base100.  
        And also to Viktor (https://github.com/stek29) for a great help while making pybase100 (well, most of work with pybase100 is done by him). Btw, he's [collecting base100 implementations](https://github.com/stek29/base100) as well.
