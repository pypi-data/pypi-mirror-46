    "# The `nbless` python package\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `nbless` you can create and execute Jupyter notebooks in\n",
    "- your terminal or\n",
    "- your favorite Python environment (e.g. PyCharm or Visual Studio Code).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nbless` python package consists of 3 functions:\n",
    "- `nbuild`, which creates a notebook from python scripts and plain text files, e.g. markdown (`.md`) and text (`.txt`) files.\n",
    "- `nbexec`, which runs a notebook from top to bottom and saves an executed version, leaving the source notebook untouched.\n",
    "- `nbless`, which calls `nbuild` and `nbexec` to create and execute a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions rely on the `nbconvert` and `nbformat` modules that are included with `jupyter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install nbless\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or clone this repo and use locally, e.g. `python nbless.py README.md plot.py notes.txt`.\n",

    "### Creating and executing a notebook with `nbless` in the terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Run `nbless` in your terminal, providing all of the names of the source files as arguments, e.g.\n",

    "```sh\n",
    "python nbless.py README.md plot.py notes.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the contents of Python code files (`.py`) are stored as Jupyter notebook code cells, while the contents of all other files are stored in markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the newly created notebook is copied, run from top to bottom and saved. The default name of the first notebook is `raw.ipynb` while the executed notebook is called `out.ipynb` by default output. The default filepath where the notebooks are saved is the current directory (`'./'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can provide more descriptive names for the notebooks and set a different path:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "nbless README.md plot.py notes.txt --raw unexecuted --out executed.ipynb --path notebooks/\n",

    "```sh\n",
    "nbuild README.md plot.py notes.txt\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "The default output filename for `nbuild` is `raw.ipynb`. The default output filepath is the current directory (`'./'`).\n",

    "To preserve the order and differentiate files that should be incorporated into the notebook, I recommend left padding your file names with zeros (e.g. 01_intro.md, 02_figure1.py).\n",
