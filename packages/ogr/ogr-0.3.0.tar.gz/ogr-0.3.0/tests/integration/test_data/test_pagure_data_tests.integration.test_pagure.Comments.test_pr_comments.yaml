        initial_comment: "This package uses names with ambiguous `python-` prefix\
          \ in requirements.\r\n\r\nAccording to [Fedora Packaging guidelines for\
          \ Python](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Python#Dependencies),\
          \ packages must use names with either `python2-` or `python3-` prefix in\
          \ requirements where available.\r\nWe are aiming to rename `python-*` dependencies\
          \ to `python2-*`, so we can later switch the `python-*` namespace to Python\
          \ 3.\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of [Fedora's Switch to Python 3 effort](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FinalizingFedoraSwitchtoPython3).\r\
          \n\r\nNote that, although this PR was created automatically, we will respond\
          \ to any comments or issues which you might find with it. We will keep the\
          \ PR open for review for a week, and if there's no feedback we'll merge\
          \ it. There is no need to build the package right after merge, this change\
          \ can wait for the next package rebuild.\r\nThe local mock build passed,\
          \ for Koji scratch build please see simple-koji-ci result.\r\n\r\nNote:\
          \ please do not backport this to f26, f27 branch(es) as some of the modified\
          \ requirements are not available there\r\n\r\n*This PR was opened automatically,\
          \ for source code see [here](https://pagure.io/python-fixrequires)*"
