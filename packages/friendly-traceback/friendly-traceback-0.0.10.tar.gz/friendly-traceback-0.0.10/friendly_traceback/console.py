Adaptation of Python's console found in code.py so that it can be
used to show some "friendly" tracebacks.

        exception (SyntaxError or OverflowError).  A syntax traceback

        2) The input is incomplete, and more input is required;
        compile_command() returned None.  Nothing happens.

        3) The input is complete; compile_command() returned a code
        object.  The code is executed by calling self.runcode() (which
        also handles run-time exceptions, except for SystemExit).

        The return value is True in case 2, False in the other cases (unless
        an exception is raised).  The return value can be used to
