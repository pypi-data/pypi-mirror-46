Description: HCP request log analytics
        =========================
        
        **hcprequestanalytics** reads HTTP access logs from log packages created by
        *Hitachi Content Platform* (HCP), loads the content into a SQL database and
        runs SQL-queries against it.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        It to provides information about topics like:
        
        *   types of requests
        *   types of requests to specific HCP nodes
        *   types of reuests from specific clients
        *   HTTP return codes
        *   size distribution of requested objects
        *   HCP internal latency distribution
        *   clients
        
        It can be easily extended with individual queries (see :doc:`30_queries`).
        
        Results are generated as a multi-sheet XLSX workbook per default; optionally,
        CSV files can be requested.
