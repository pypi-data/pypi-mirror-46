        About Amplify

        that empower teachers and students across the country. We have a long
        history as the leading innovator in K-12 education - and have been

        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        amplify\_aws\_utils requires the following to be installed:
        
        ::
        
            python >= 3.6
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package can be installed using ``pip``
        
        ``pip install amplify_aws_utils``
        
        Building From Source
        --------------------
        
        For development, ``tox>=2.9.1`` is recommended.
        
        Python package can be built as follows:
        
        ``python setup.py sdist``
        
        This creates a package in ``dist`` directory.
        
        Running Tests
        -------------
        
        ``amplify_aws_utils`` uses ``tox``. You will need to install tox with
        ``pip install tox``. Running ``tox`` will automatically execute linters
        as well as the unit tests. You can also run them individually with the
        -e argument.
        
        For example, ``tox -e lint,py36-unit`` will run the linters, and then
        the unit tests in python 3.6
        
        To see all the available options, run ``tox -l``.
        
        Deployment
        ----------
        
        Deployment is done with Travis.
        
        Package is built as described above, and is uploaded to PyPI repo using
        ``devpi-client``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Functions provided by this package can be imported after package has
        been installed.
