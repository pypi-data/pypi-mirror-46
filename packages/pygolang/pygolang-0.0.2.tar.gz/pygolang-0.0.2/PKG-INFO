Description: ========================================
         Pygolang - Go-like features for Python
        ========================================
        
        Package `golang` provides Go-like features for Python:
        
        - `gpython` is Python interpreter with support for lightweight threads.
        - `go` spawns lightweight thread.
        - `chan` and `select` provide channels with Go semantic.
        - `func` allows to define methods separate from class.
        - `defer` allows to schedule a cleanup from the main control flow.
        - `gimport` allows to import python modules by full path in a Go workspace.
        
        Additional packages and utilities are also provided__ to close other gaps
        between Python and Go environments.
        
        __ `Additional packages and utilities`_
        
        
        GPython
        -------
        
        Command `gpython` provides Python interpreter that supports lightweight threads
        via tight integration with gevent__. The standard library of GPython is API
        compatible with Python standard library, but inplace of OS threads lightweight
        coroutines are provided, and IO is internally organized via
        libuv__/libev__-based IO scheduler. Consequently programs can spawn lots of
        coroutines cheaply, and modules like `time`, `socket`, `ssl`, `subprocess` etc -
        all could be used from all coroutines simultaneously, and in the same blocking way
        as if every coroutine was a full OS thread. This gives ability to scale programs
        without changing concurrency model and existing code.
        
        __ http://www.gevent.org/
        __ http://libuv.org/
        __ http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html
        
        
        Additionally GPython sets UTF-8 to be default encoding always, and puts `go`,
        `chan`, `select` etc into builtin namespace.
        
        .. note::
        
           GPython is optional and the rest of Pygolang can be used from under standard Python too.
           However without gevent integration `go` spawns full - not lightweight - OS thread.
        
        
        Goroutines and channels
        -----------------------
        
        `go` spawns a coroutine, or thread if gevent was not activated. It is possible to
        exchange data in between either threads or coroutines via channels. `chan`
        creates a new channel with Go semantic - either synchronous or buffered. Use
        `chan.recv`, `chan.send` and `chan.close` for communication. `nilchan`
        stands for the nil channel. `select` can be used to multiplex on several
        channels. For example::
        
            ch1 = chan()    # synchronous channel
            ch2 = chan(3)   # channel with buffer of size 3
        
            def _():
                ch1.send('a')
                ch2.send('b')
            go(_)
        
            ch1.recv()      # will give 'a'
            ch2.recv_()     # will give ('b', True)
        
            ch2 = nilchan   # rebind ch2 to nil channel
            _, _rx = select(
                ch1.recv,           # 0
                ch1.recv_,          # 1
                (ch1.send, obj),    # 2
                ch2.recv,           # 3
                default,            # 4
            )
            if _ == 0:
                # _rx is what was received from ch1
                ...
            if _ == 1:
                # _rx is (rx, ok) of what was received from ch1
                ...
            if _ == 2:
                # we know obj was sent to ch1
                ...
            if _ == 3:
                # this case will be never selected because
                # send/recv on nil channel block forever.
                ...
            if _ == 4:
                # default case
                ...
        
        Methods
        -------
        
        `func` decorator allows to define methods separate from class.
        
        For example::
        
          @func(MyClass)
          def my_method(self, ...):
              ...
        
        will define `MyClass.my_method()`.
        
        `func` can be also used on just functions, for example::
        
          @func
          def my_function(...):
              ...
        
        
        Defer / recover / panic
        -----------------------
        
        `defer` allows to schedule a cleanup to be executed when current function
        returns. It is similar to `try`/`finally` but does not force the cleanup part
        to be far away in the end. For example::
        
           wc = wcfs.join(zurl)    │     wc = wcfs.join(zurl)
           defer(wc.close)         │     try:
                                   │        ...
           ...                     │        ...
           ...                     │        ...
           ...                     │     finally:
                                   │        wc.close()
        
        For completeness there is `recover` and `panic` that allow to program with
        Go-style error handling, for example::
        
           def _():
              r = recover()
              if r is not None:
                 print("recovered. error was: %s" % (r,))
           defer(_)
        
           ...
        
           panic("aaa")
        
        But `recover` and `panic` are probably of less utility since they can be
        practically natively modelled with `try`/`except`.
        
        If `defer` is used, the function that uses it must be wrapped with `@func`
        decorator.
        
        Import
        ------
        
        `gimport` provides way to import python modules by full path in a Go workspace.
        
        For example
        
        ::
        
            lonet = gimport('lab.nexedi.com/kirr/go123/xnet/lonet')
        
        will import either
        
        - `lab.nexedi.com/kirr/go123/xnet/lonet.py`, or
        - `lab.nexedi.com/kirr/go123/xnet/lonet/__init__.py`
        
        located in `src/` under `$GOPATH`.
        
        --------
        
        Additional packages and utilities
        ---------------------------------
        
        The following additional packages and utilities are also provided to close gaps
        between Python and Go environments:
        
        .. contents::
           :local:
        
        Concurrency
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In addition to `go` and channels, the following packages are provided to help
        handle concurrency in structured ways:
        
        - `golang.context` provides contexts to propagate deadlines, cancellation and
          task-scoped values among spawned goroutines [*]_.
        
        - `golang.sync` provides `sync.WorkGroup` to spawn group of goroutines working
          on a common task. It also provides low-level primitives - for example
          `sync.Once` and `sync.WaitGroup` - that are sometimes useful too.
        
        - `golang.time` provides timers integrated with channels.
        
        .. [*] See `Go Concurrency Patterns: Context`__ for overview of contexts.
        
        __ https://blog.golang.org/context
        
        
        String conversion
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        `qq` (import from `golang.gcompat`) provides `%q` functionality that quotes as
        Go would do. For example the following code will print name quoted in `"`
        without escaping printable UTF-8 characters::
        
           print('hello %s' % qq(name))
        
        `qq` accepts both `str` and `bytes` (`unicode` and `str` on Python2)
        and also any other type that can be converted to `str`.
        
        Package `golang.strconv` provides direct access to conversion routines, for
        example `strconv.quote` and `strconv.unquote`.
        
        
        Benchmarking and testing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        `py.bench` allows to benchmark python code similarly to `go test -bench` and `py.test`.
        For example, running `py.bench` on the following code::
        
            def bench_add(b):
                x, y = 1, 2
                for i in xrange(b.N):
                    x + y
        
        gives something like::
        
            $ py.bench --count=3 x.py
            ...
            pymod: bench_add.py
            Benchmarkadd    50000000        0.020 µs/op
            Benchmarkadd    50000000        0.020 µs/op
            Benchmarkadd    50000000        0.020 µs/op
        
        Package `golang.testing` provides corresponding runtime bits, e.g. `testing.B`.
        
        `py.bench` produces output in `Go benchmark format`__, and so benchmark results
        can be analyzed and compared with standard Go tools, for example with
        `benchstat`__.
        Additionally package `golang.x.perf.benchlib` can be used to load and process
        such benchmarking data in Python.
