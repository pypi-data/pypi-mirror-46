Description: Coop - base for all (most) Takeflight sites
        ===========================================
        
        This is a base to build all Takeflight sites off. This package contains all the
        common code shared between sites, with the ideal Takeflight site containing only
        model definitions, templates, and front end assets.
        
        Making a release
        ----------------
        
        Upgrade the version in ``coop/_version.py``.
        Coops version stays in step with Wagtail. i.e. Coop 2.4.x uses Wagtail 2.4.x.
        Point releases are used to add features during a Wagtail version lifespan.
        
        Update the CHANGELOG. Please.
        
        Tag your release:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ git tag "x.y.z"
            $ git push --tags
        
        Make a virtual environment and activate it. You may already have one from last time:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ python3 -m venv venv
            $ source venv/bin/activate
            $ pip install wheel # Only required once per venv
        
        Then, package up and publish the package:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ ./setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload
        
        And you are done!
