ST Pipeline is a tool to process the Spatial Transcriptomics raw data
or single cell data.
The data is filtered, aligned to a genome, annotated to a reference,
demultiplexed by array coordinates and then aggregated by counts
that are not duplicates using the Unique Molecular Indentifiers.
The output contains the counts matrix, a stats file, a log file
and a BED file with all the transcripts.

The ST Pipeline requires two fastq files, an IDs files (BARCODE, X, Y),
the path to a STAR genome index, the path to a annotation file in GTF
format and a dataset name.

The ST Pipeline has many parameters, you can see a description of them
by typing : st_pipeline_run.py --help

Note that the minimum read length is dependant on the type of kit used, and
should be adjusted accordingly, i.e. a 150bp kit should have a different
minimum read length than a 75bp kit.

Soft clipping is also not recommended when using the 75bp kit, due to the
shorter length.

The UMI filter can be used for array batches 1000L6 and earlier. It is
unable to be used for array batches 1000L7 and newer as the UMI in
these arrays is fully randomised.

                                      Subglobal, Levenshtein or Hamming 
                                      (default: Subglobal)
  --demultiplexing-multiple-hits-keep-one  When multiple ambiguous hits with same score are 
                                      found in the demultiplexing, keep one (random)
  --demultiplexing-trim-sequences     Trims from the barcodes in the input file when doing demultiplexing.
                            	      The bases given in the list of tuples as START END START END .. where
                                      START is the integer position of the first base (0 based) and END is the integer
                                      position of the last base (1 based).
