Description: # CDK Construct library for higher-level ECS Constructs
        
        This library provides higher-level ECS constructs which follow common architectural patterns. It contains:
        
        * Scheduled Tasks (cron jobs)
        
        ## Scheduled Tasks
        
        To define a task that runs periodically, instantiate an `ScheduledEc2Task`:
        
        
        ```ts
        // Instantiate an Amazon EC2 Task to run at a scheduled interval
        const ecsScheduledTask = new ScheduledEc2Task(this, 'ScheduledTask', {
          cluster,
          image: ecs.ContainerImage.fromRegistry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample"),
          scheduleExpression: 'rate(1 minute)',
          environment: [{ name: 'TRIGGER', value: 'CloudWatch Events' }],
          memoryLimitMiB: 256
        });
        ```
