## Wrapper Class around Psycopg2 for PostgreSQL
* In psycopg2 after connecting to the database, for every read execute statement the data needs to be fetched and for evey write execute statement the data needs to be committed. But this class eliminates these requirements and make it simple to read and write to the database.

# Files:
* palpg/__init__.py

## Installation:
* sudo pip3 install palpg

## Usage Examples:
* import palpg
* db = palpg.db("host=HOST port=PORT dbname=DBNAME user=USER password=PASSWORD")  ##-connect to the database as user
* db.read("sql statement")  ##-returns the read data from database with flat=True
* db.read("select item from table", flat=False)  ##-returns the raw read data 
* db.read("select item from table where item = %s", (sub1,))  ##-read with string substitution
* db.read1("sql statement")  ##-returns the first read data similar to fetchone
* db.write("sql statement")  ##-writes the data and commits to the database
* db.clear()  #-to reconnect if any transaction error

## For other psycopg connection commands use the connection class
* db.conn....
