        Introduction
        ============
        Complex number to perceptually uniform RGB subset mapping library.
        
        This library operates on buffer object using numpy, and is designed to convert a 2d array of complex number in to an 2d array to 3-tuples of RGB values suitable for passing to matplotlib's imshow function
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        ZtoRGBpy can be install from PyPI_, using the command:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ pip install ZtoRGBpy
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - numpy_: 1.x >= 1.6
        - Plotting Functions:
        
          - matplotlib_: 1.x >= 1.3 or 2.x
        
        Version Numbering
        -----------------
        
        ZtoRGBpy user a version numbering system based on PEP440_, with versions numbers ``{major:d}.{minor:d}[.{patch:d}][.dev{year:0<4d}{month:0<2d}{day:0<2d}]`` providing a minimum of major and minor version, with optional patch number for bug fixes, and development tag for pre-release builds.
        
        Major Version
        +++++++++++++
        New Major Version Release, may change the public API in non backwards compatible ways, that may break existing code.
        
        Minor Version
        +++++++++++++
        Minor Version, releases may add new features to the public API, but will remain fully backwards compatible with the document API for the Major Version Series.
        
        Patch Version 
        +++++++++++++
        Patch are solely for fixing bugs in the code or API, these will only change the public API when it is found to perform in a manor contrary to the documented API
        
        Development Version
        +++++++++++++++++++
        This is a Development release, has not be tested, it may be unstable or have breaks in the API, such a release should NOT be relied upon.
