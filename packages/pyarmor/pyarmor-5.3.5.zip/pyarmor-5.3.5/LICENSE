  2. The software is distributed as Free To Use But Restricted. This means that
     anyone may use the software for non-commercial usage. In free version the
     python scripts are obfuscated with fixed key, that is to say, everyone uses
     the same key to obfuscate python scripts in free version. For any
     commercial usage or to obfuscate python scripts by random key, the user
     must purchase a license to continue using the software.

  3. There are 2 basic types of licenses issued for the software. These are:

     a. A natural person usage license for home users. The user purchases one

        Home users may use their natural person usage license on all computers
        and embedded devices which are property of the license owner.

     b. A juridical person usage license for business users. The user purchases
        one license to use the software for one product or one project of an
        organization.

        Business users may use their juridical person usage license on all
        computers and embedded devices for one product or project. But they
        require another license for different product or project.

     A user who purchased a license, is granted a non-exclusive right to use
     the software on as many computers as defined by the licensing terms above
     according to the number of licenses purchased, for any legal purpose.

  4. There are no additional license fees, apart from the cost of the license,
     associated with the creation and distribution of obfuscated python scripts.

     obfuscated python scripts and to distribute those files free of any
     additional royalties.
