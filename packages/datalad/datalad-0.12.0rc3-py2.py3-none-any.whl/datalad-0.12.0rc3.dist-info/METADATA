10000ft overview
================

DataLad makes data management and data distribution more accessible. To
do that, it stands on the shoulders of `Git <https://git-scm.com>`__ and
`Git-annex <http://git-annex.branchable.com>`__ to deliver a
decentralized system for data exchange. This includes automated
ingestion of data from online portals and exposing it in readily usable
form as Git(-annex) repositories, so-called datasets. The actual data
storage and permission management, however, remains with the original
data providers.

The full documentation is available at: http://docs.datalad.org

Extensions
==========

A number of extensions are available that provide additional
functionality for DataLad. Extensions are separate packages that are to
be installed in addition to DataLad. In order to install DataLad
customized for a particular domain, one can simply install an extension
directly, and DataLad itself will be automatically installed with it.
Here is a list of known extensions:

-  `tracking web resources and automated data
   distributions <https://github.com/datalad/datalad-crawler>`__
   `crawler
   release <https://GitHub.com/datalad/datalad-crawler/releases/>`__
-  `neuroimaging research data and
   workflows <https://github.com/datalad/datalad-neuroimaging>`__
   `neuroimaging
   release <https://GitHub.com/datalad/datalad-neuroimaging/releases/>`__
-  `support for containerized computational
   environments <https://github.com/datalad/datalad-container>`__
   `container
   release <https://GitHub.com/datalad/datalad-container/releases/>`__
-  `alternative set of basic commands with improved cross-platform
   support <https://github.com/datalad/datalad-revolution>`__
   `revolution

The documentation of this project is found here: http://docs.datalad.org

All bugs, concerns and enhancement requests for this software can be
submitted here: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues

If you have a problem or would like to ask a question about how to use
DataLad, please `submit a question to
NeuroStars.org <https://neurostars.org/new-topic?body=-%20Please%20describe%20the%20problem.%0A-%20What%20steps%20will%20reproduce%20the%20problem%3F%0A-%20What%20version%20of%20DataLad%20are%20you%20using%20%28run%20%60datalad%20--version%60%29%3F%20On%20what%20operating%20system%20%28consider%20running%20%60datalad%20plugin%20wtf%60%29%3F%0A-%20Please%20provide%20any%20additional%20information%20below.%0A-%20Have%20you%20had%20any%20luck%20using%20DataLad%20before%3F%20%28Sometimes%20we%20get%20tired%20of%20reading%20bug%20reports%20all%20day%20and%20a%20lil'%20positive%20end%20note%20does%20wonders%29&tags=datalad>`__
with a ``datalad`` tag. NeuroStars.org is a platform similar to
StackOverflow but dedicated to neuroinformatics.

Installation
============

Debian-based systems
--------------------

On Debian-based systems, we recommend to enable
`NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.net>`__ from which we provide recent
releases of DataLad. Once enabled, just do:

::

   apt-get install datalad

Other Linux’es, OSX via pip
---------------------------

Before you install this package, please make sure that you `install a
recent version of
git-annex <https://git-annex.branchable.com/install>`__. Afterwards,
install the latest version of ``datalad`` from
`PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/datalad>`__. It is recommended to use a
dedicated `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__:

::

   # create and enter a new virtual environment (optional)
   virtualenv --python=python3 ~/env/datalad
   . ~/env/datalad/bin/activate

   # install from PyPi
   pip install datalad

By default, installation via pip installs core functionality of datalad
allowing for managing datasets etc. Additional installation schemes are
available, so you could provide enhanced installation via
``pip install datalad[SCHEME]`` where ``SCHEME`` could be

-  ``tests`` to also install dependencies used by unit-tests battery of
   the datalad
-  ``full`` to install all dependencies.

There is also a `Singularity container <http://singularity.lbl.gov>`__
available. The latest release version can be obtained by running:

::

   singularity pull shub://datalad/datalad
