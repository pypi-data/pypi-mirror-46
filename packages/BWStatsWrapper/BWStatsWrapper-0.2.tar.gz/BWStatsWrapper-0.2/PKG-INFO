Description: # Hypixel Bedwars Statistics API Wrapper
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Heknon/Bedwars-Stats-Wrapper-Python)
        
        Easily access the Bedwars statistics of any hypixel player with one line of code in Python!
        
        # New Features!
        
          - **stat_grab()** 
          When doing ```bedwars("level, wins_bedwars", "Heknon")``` 
        It will return this list `['Level: 105', 'wins_bedwars: 966']`
        **What if you have a list of lots of statistics and want a specific statistic?**
        ***Examples:***
            > `heknon = bedwars("level, wins_bedwars", "Heknon")`
            > `stat_grab("Level", heknon)` Besure to write the specified statistic as it is in the outputed list with or without the colon
        
        ### Examples
        You can add you API Key using `addkeys("APIKEY HERE")` after adding a key you need to run the program once so it will create the file to store the key.
        You can call as many statistics as you want for a player and its considered one request. `bedwars("level, Experience, kills_bedwars, etc...", "NAME")`
        
        ****
        - **Example Code**
        > ```
        > from BWStatsWrapper import addkeys, stat_grab, bedwars
        > addkeys("APIKEY, Another API Key <not necessary right now as it won't alternate between keys>")
        > heknon = bedwars("level, wins_bedwars", "Heknon")  # DO NOT MAKE MORE THEN 120 OF THESE REQUESTS PER MINUTE
        > gamerboy80 = bedwars("level, wins_bedwars", "gamerboy80")
        > print(stat_grab("wins_bedwars", heknon))  # --> OUTPUT: 966
        > print(stat_grab("wins_bedwars", gamerboy80))  # --> OUTPUT: 21258
        > print(stat_grab("Level", gamerboy80))  # --> OUTPUT: 1154
            This code will return an error on its first run but not on it's second run as it is adding keys while also requesting for data.
        # TODO
        Add alternating API Keys.
