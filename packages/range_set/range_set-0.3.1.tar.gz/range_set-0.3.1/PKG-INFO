        ---------
        
        Python Sets are nice to work with, but very inefficient if you need a large
        set with mostly-consecutive integers. The RangeSet class provides efficient
        handling and storage for these sets.
        
        Non-integers?
        =============
        
        RangeSet works with any class whose instances are
        
        * comparable
        
        * step-able, i.e. you can add 1 to them / subtract 1 from them.
        
        * discrete, i.e. there is no value between ``n`` and ``n+1``.
        
        RangeSet doesn't add or subtract any other values, nor does it try to
        subtract two instances from each other.
        
        The requirement to subtract 1 is an optimization that could be removed if
        necessary.
