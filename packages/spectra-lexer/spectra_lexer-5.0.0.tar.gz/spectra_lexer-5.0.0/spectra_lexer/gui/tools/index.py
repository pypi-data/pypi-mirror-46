using your Plover dictionary. The default file size is around 10 MB, and can take anywhere
between 5 seconds and 5 minutes depending on the speed of your machine and hard disk. Would you
like to create one now? You will not be asked again.</p>

the Tools menu, and can expand it from the default size as well if it is not sufficient).</p>"""

<p>size = 12: average-sized index (default).</p>
