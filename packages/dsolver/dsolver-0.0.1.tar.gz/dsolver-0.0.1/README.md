# DSolver
### **Python Dependencies Resolver** 

dsolver helps you resolve dependencies for any python script by recursively installing required python packages automatically

## Installation

```
pip install dsolver
```

## Uses

For instance, we have to resolve dependencies for python script `test.py`
