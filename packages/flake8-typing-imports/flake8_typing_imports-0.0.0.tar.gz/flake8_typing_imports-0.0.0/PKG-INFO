        flake8-typing-imports
        =====================
        
        flake8 plugin which checks that typing imports are properly guarded
        
        ## installation
        
        `pip install flake8-typing-imports`
        
        ## rationale
        
        depending on your supported version of python, you may need to guard your
        imports by `if TYPE_CHECKING:` (3.5.2+) or `if False:` if the things you are
        importing aren't available in all the pythons you support.
        
        unfortunately, the `typing` module has been pretty unstable -- it has seen api
        changes in 3.5.0, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 3.5.4, 3.6.0, 3.6.1, 3.6.2, and 3.7.0!
        
        as it's pretty difficult to keep track of what version things changed and you
        can't always test against particular patch versions of python, this plugin
        helps you statically check this automatically!
        
        ## configuration
        
        this plugin has a single configuration point (beyond those provided by flake8)
        which is the `--min-python-version` option.
        
        by default, this option is `3.5.0`.  this includes all versions of python
        which have the `typing` module present.
        
        you can also set this option in the flake8 configuration if you don't want
        to use the commandline:
        
        ```ini
        [flake8]
        min_python_version = 3.6.2
        ```
        
        ## as a pre-commit hook
        
        See [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) for instructions
        
        Sample `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
        
        ```yaml
        -   repo: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8
            rev: 3.7.7
            hooks:
            -   id: flake8
                additional_dependencies: [flake8-typing-imports==0.0.0]
        ```
