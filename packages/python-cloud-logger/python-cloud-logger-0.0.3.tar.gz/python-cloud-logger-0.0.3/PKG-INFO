Description: # python-cloud-logger
        
        A logger with thread local storage for logging context in all logs without repeating the code. This is a json logger where some contextual fields need to be included in every log per request/thread in a safe and efficient way.
        
        Note that, all the loggers retrieved on that particular thread ( by using logging.getLogger ) will inherit the context.
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        
        from pythoncloudlogger import *
        
        logger=logging.getLogger("myapp-logger")
        
        logger.updateContext({
          "requestId" : "1245"
        })
        
        logger.info("Request successfully processed")
        
        logger.clearContext()
        
        ```
