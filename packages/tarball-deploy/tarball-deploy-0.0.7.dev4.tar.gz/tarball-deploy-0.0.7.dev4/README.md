`tarball-deploy` is an utility to facilitate deploying code (or any files, for
that matter) packed into TAR archives. It handles unpacking received archives,
and switching to new releases atomically (using a little bit of symlink magic).

Use cases
---------

`tarball-deploy` has been written with shared web hosting services in mind,
which usually grant you SSH access to a shared server, and one or more
`public_html` directories, where you're expected to put your website files (eg.
static HTML, or PHP scripts). This tool attempts to address the following
problems:
* How to copy new release of your website from your CI/CD pipeline (you have
  one, right?) to your server.
* How to switch to the new release atomically, so that the site is in
  consistent state all the time.

Requirements
------------

* A decent UNIX-like system, which will let you install custom Python scripts
* A `tar` implementation. GNU Tar and libarchive (FreeBSD) tar are known to
  work.

Installation
------------

Remember that `tarball-deploy` is expected to be installed on your server. The
easiest way is to install it with `pip`:
```sh
$ pip install tarball-deploy
```

You might, however, want or need to install it in a virtualenv and symlink
somewhere in your `$PATH`.

Usage
-----

For every website you want to manage, you will need to:
* Generate an SSH keypair for your CI runner
* Edit `.ssh/authorized_keys` on your server and add something similar to:
  ```
  restrict,command="tarball-deploy --workdir=/your/remote/deployment/dir --from=-" ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza...
  ```
* Symink `/your/remote/deployment/dir/current` to a place where your web server
  is expected to find your site content (usually something like
  `~/domains/example.com/public_html`)
