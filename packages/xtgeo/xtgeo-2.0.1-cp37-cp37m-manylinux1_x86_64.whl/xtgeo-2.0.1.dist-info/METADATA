## Introduction ##

XTGeo is a LGPL licensed Python library with C backend to support
manipulation of (oil industry) subsurface reservoir modelling. Typical
users are geoscientist and reservoir engineers working with
reservoir modelling, in relation with RMS. XTGeo is developed in Equinor.

## Feature summary ##

   * Python 2.7+ and 3.4+ is supported
   * Focus on high speed, using numpy and pandas with C backend
   * Regular surfaces, i.e. 2D maps with regular sampling and rotation
   * 3D grids (corner-point), supporting several formats such as
     RMS and Eclipse
   * Support of seismic cubes, using
     [segyio](https://github.com/equinor/segyio) as backend for SEGY format
   * Support of well data, line and polygons (still somewhat immature)
   * Operations between the data types listed above; e.g. slice a surface
     with a seismic cube
   * Integration to ROXAR API python for several data types is supported
     (see note later)
   * Currently, Linux only is supported

## Installation ##

For some versions, PYPI installation is possible:

```
pip install xtgeo
```
For detailed installation instructions (implies C compiling), see
the documentation.


## Getting started ##

```python
from xtgeo.surface import RegularSurface

# create an instance of a surface, read from file
mysurf = RegularSurface('myfile.gri')  # Irap binary as default

print('Mean is {}'.format(mysurf.values.mean()))

# change date so all values less than 2000 becomes 2000
# The values attribute gives the Numpy array

mysurface.values[mysurface.values < 2000] = 2000

# export the modified surface:
mysurface.to_file('newfile.gri')
```

## Note on RMS Roxar API integration ##

The following applies to the part of the XTGeo API that is
connected to Roxar API (RMS):

> RMS is neither an open source software nor a free software and
> any use of it needs a software license agreement in place.
