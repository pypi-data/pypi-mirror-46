        # Benefits
        - Visualisation can be added as a documentation artefact to your project
        - Having many explicit/implicit dependencies can slow down deployments. Use the generated dependency graph to quickly spot bottlenecks due to these dependencies. 
        
        # Installation
        
        Install graphviz for your operating system as per [official instuctions](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/).
        
        Install this package in the same python interpreter (virtualenv) that Sceptre is installed so that its python library is already available:
        `pip install sceptre-dot`
        
        # Usage
        In the same directory where you would normally invoke `sceptre launch -y $YOUR_PATH`, run: 
        
        ```bash
        sceptre-dot $YOUR_PATH > output.dot
        fdp -Tpng output.dot -o output.png # use fdp engine for best results
        ```
