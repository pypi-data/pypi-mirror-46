[![Doc Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pip/badge/?version=latest&style=flat)](https://utoolbox.readthedocs.io/) 
A Python image processing package for LLSM.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
It is encouraged to use environment wrapper and package manager, conda is chosen as the reference solution. Please follow the [installation section](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html) in their official guide.

Some of the codes require CUDA dependency, please download the binary release from the [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

For the time being, these are the tested version combination during development and deployment.
**TODO** add environment description

#### macOS
- High Sierra 10.13.6, Darwin 17.7.0
- CUDA 9.2.64.1

#### Windows
- Windows 7 (64-bit) SP1
- CUDA 9.2.88.1

#### Linux
- Debian 8.10 (jessie), Linux 3.12.72
- CUDA 8.0.44


### Installing
Following step-by-step instructions will demonstrate how to get a development environment running.

Clone this repository to somewhere convenient.
```
git clone https://github.com/liuyenting/utoolbox.git
cd utoolbox
```

Install the conda environment by
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate utoolbox-dev
```
this will prepare an environment with required development tools under the name `utoolbox-dev`.

Since pip does not honor the `setup_requires` description, basic requirements and native libraries are installed using conda in preivous step.

Next, we install this toolbox using editable mode
```
pip install -e .
```

To test the toolbox, run
```
pytest
```


## Deployment
These steps will deploy this package on a live system for general use.

Please ensure `numpy` is pre-installed in your environment before install through pip.
```
pip install utoolbox
```
