        A Python image processing package for LLSM.
        
        ## Getting Started
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        It is encouraged to use environment wrapper and package manager, conda is chosen as the reference solution. Please follow the [installation section](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html) in their official guide.
        
        Some of the codes require CUDA dependency, please download the binary release from the [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
        
        For the time being, these are the tested version combination during development and deployment.
        **TODO** add environment description
        
        #### macOS
        - High Sierra 10.13.6, Darwin 17.7.0
        - CUDA 9.2.64.1
        
        #### Windows
        - Windows 7 (64-bit) SP1
        - CUDA 9.2.88.1
        
        #### Linux
        - Debian 8.10 (jessie), Linux 3.12.72
        - CUDA 8.0.44
        
        
        ### Installing
        Following step-by-step instructions will demonstrate how to get a development environment running.
        
        Clone this repository to somewhere convenient.
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/liuyenting/utoolbox.git
        cd utoolbox
        ```
        
        Install the conda environment by
        ```
        conda env create -f environment.yml
        conda activate utoolbox-dev
        ```
        this will prepare an environment with required development tools under the name `utoolbox-dev`.
        
        Since pip does not honor the `setup_requires` description, basic requirements and native libraries are installed using conda in preivous step.
        
        Next, we install this toolbox using editable mode
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        To test the toolbox, run
        ```
        pytest
        ```
        
        
        ## Deployment
        These steps will deploy this package on a live system for general use.
        
        Please ensure `numpy` is pre-installed in your environment before install through pip.
        ```
        pip install utoolbox
        ```
