=========
 Arronax
=========

`Arronax <http://www.florian-diesch.de/software/arronax/>`__ is GUI
program to create and edit starter files (*.desktop* files) for
applications locations or URLs. It can be used as a standalone
application or as plugins for the file managers Nautilus, Nemo and
Caja.

The plugins add a menu item "Create starter for this file" or "Create
a starter for this program" to the context menu (that's the menu you
get when you right-click a file) in the file manager. If the file is a
application starter you get an item "Modify this starter" instead.

On some desktop environments the plugins add a menu item "Create
starter" to your desktop's context menu.

Arronax supports most of the `keys <https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s06.html>`__ specified by the `Desktop Entry Specification <https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/index.html>`__ including `quicklists <https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s11.html>`__.
