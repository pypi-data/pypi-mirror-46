'''
A module for computing a symbolic approximation of \
the set :math:`\mathcal M_e` consisting of all basic sums included in series \
:math:`\lambda` :eq:`lambda` described in :ref:`sect-theory_bs` of online \
documentation.

Available functions:

    - :py:func:`sums_in_Bq`: returns list of multi-indexes of basic sums \
    included in the coefficient :math:`B_q`.
    - :py:func:`sums_in_Gq`: returns list of multi-indexes of basic sums \
    included in the set :math:`G_q`.
    - :py:func:`sums_in_Gq_prime`: returns list of multi-indexes of basic sums \
    included in the set :math:`G_q'`.
    
The :py:func:`sums_in_Bq`, :py:func:`sums_in_Gq`, and :py:func:`sums_in_Bq` \
functions are equipped with methods and algorithms developed in [#Naw2016]_ \
(for the definition of :math:`B_q`, :math:`G_q`, and :math:`G_q'`  sets see \
the paper as well as :ref:`Approximation of Me and symbolic precision \
<sect-theory_Gq_prime>` section of the online documentations).
