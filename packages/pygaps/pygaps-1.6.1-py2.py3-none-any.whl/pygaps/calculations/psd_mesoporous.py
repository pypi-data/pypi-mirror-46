    *Description*

    The BJH or Barrett, Joyner and Halenda [#]_ method for calculation of pore size distribution
    is based on a classical description of the adsorbate behaviour in the adsorbent pores.
    Under this method, the adsorbate is adsorbing on the pore walls in a predictable way,
    and decreasing the apparent pore volume until condensation takes place, filling the
    entire pore. The two variables, layer thickness and radius where condensation takes
    place can be modelled by a thickness model (such as Halsey, Harkins & Jura, etc.) and a
    critical radius model for condensation/evaporation, based on a form of the Kelvin equation.

    .. math::

        r_p = t + r_k

    The original model used the desorption curve as a basis for calculating pore size distribution.
    Between two points of the curve, the volume desorbed can be described as the volume contribution
    from pore evaporation and the volume from layer thickness decrease as per the equation
    above. The computation is done cumulatively, starting from the filled pores and calculating for each
    point the volume adsorbed in a pore from the following equation:

    .. math::

        V_p & = \Big(\frac{\bar{r}_p}{\bar{r}_k + \Delta t_n}\Big)^2
                (\Delta V_n - \Delta t_n \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \Delta A_p
                + \Delta t_n \bar{t}_n \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{\Delta A_p}{\bar{r}_p})

        A & = 2 \Delta V_p / r_p

    Where :
        - :math:`\Delta A_p` is the area of the pores
        - :math:`\Delta V_p` is the adsorbed volume change between two points
        - :math:`\bar{r}_p` is the average pore radius calculated as a sum of the
          kelvin radius and layer thickness of the pores at pressure p between two
          measurement points
        - :math:`\bar{r}_k` is the average kelvin radius between two measurement points
        - :math:`\bar{t}_n` is the average layer thickness between two measurement points
        - :math:`\Delta t_n` is the average change in layer thickness between two measurement points

    Then, by plotting :math:`\Delta V / (2*\Delta r_p)` versus the width of the pores calculated
    for each point, the pore size distribution can be obtained.

    *Description*

    The DH or Dollimore-Heal method [#]_ of calculation of pore size distribution is an
    extension of the BJH method, which takes into account the geometry of the pores
    by introducing a length component.

    Like the BJH method, it is based on a classical description of the adsorbate behaviour
    in the adsorbent pores. Under this method, the adsorbate is adsorbing on the pore walls
    in a predictable way, and decreasing the apparent pore volume until condensation takes
    place, filling the entire pore. The two variables, layer thickness and radius where
    condensation takes place can be modelled by a thickness model (such as Halsey, Harkins
    & Jura, etc.) and a critical radius model for condensation/evaporation, based
    on a form of the Kelvin equation.

    .. math::

        r_p = t + r_k

    The original model used the desorption curve as a basis for calculating pore size distribution.
    Between two points of the curve, the volume desorbed can be described as the volume contribution
    from pore evaporation and the volume from layer thickness decrease as per the equation
    above. The computation is done cumulatively, starting from the filled pores and calculating for each
    point the volume adsorbed in a pore from the following equation:

    .. math::

        V_p & = \Big(\frac{\bar{r}_p}{\bar{r}_k + \Delta t_n}\Big)^2
                (\Delta V_n - \Delta t_n \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \Delta A_p
                + 2 \pi \Delta t_n \bar{t}_n \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} L_p)

        A & = 2 \Delta V_p / r_p

        L & = \Delta A_p / 2 \pi r_p

    Where :
        - :math:`\Delta A_p` is the area of the pores
        - :math:`\Delta V_p` is the adsorbed volume change between two points
        - :math:`\bar{r}_p` is the average pore radius calculated as a sum of the
          kelvin radius and layer thickness of the pores at pressure p between two
          measurement points
        - :math:`\bar{r}_k` is the average kelvin radius between two measurement points
        - :math:`\bar{t}_n` is the average layer thickness between two measurement points
        - :math:`\Delta t_n` is the average change in layer thickness between two measurement points

    Then, by plotting :math:`\Delta V/(2*\Delta r_p)` versus the width of the pores calculated
    for each point, the pore size distribution can be obtained.
