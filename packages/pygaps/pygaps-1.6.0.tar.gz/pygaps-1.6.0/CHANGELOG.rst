=========

1.6.0 (2019-05-08)
------------------

New features:

* Added a function to get isotherms from the NIST ISODB,
  ``pygaps.load_nist_isotherm`` which takes the ISODB filename
  as an argument.
* Added hexane as an adsorbate in the database.
* Isotherm adsorbate is now a pygaps.Adsorbate object and
  can be accessed directly for all attributes
  (only when available in the internal database, otherwise still a string).
* ModelIsotherms can now be saved and imported from JSON, CSV and Excel.
* Added a ``marker`` option to the ``plot_iso`` function
  which acts similar to the ``color`` parameter and allows
  simple selection of the marker style.
* Added three new isotherm models: Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich and
  Dubinin-Astakov. They can be used for fitting by specifying
  `Freundlich`, `DR` or `DA` as the model, respectivelly.
* Faster performance of some models due to analytical calculations,
  as well as more thorough testing
* Isotherm modelling backend is now more robust.
* Added an isotherm ``plot`` function to plot an individual isotherm.
* Added functions to import and export JSON files directly from a
  file: ``isotherm_from_jsonf`` and ``isotherm_to_jsonf``.
* Added github issue templates.
* Removed some plotting styles.

Breaking changes:

* Deprecated and removed the MADIREL excel format.
* Renamed ``isosteric_heat`` functions as ``isosteric_enthalpy`` for
  more correct nomenclature.
* Some model parameters have been renamed for consistency.

Bugfixes:

* REFPROP backend now correctly accessible
  (it was previously impossible to activate).
* Fixed issue in excel import which could lead to
  incorrect import.
* Some of the adsorbate values in the database were incorrect.
  They have been now updated.
* Fixed secondary data not being automatically plotted
  when ``print_info`` called.


1.5.0 (2019-03-12)
------------------

New features:

* Increased number of adsorbates available in pyGAPS to 40.
* New material characterisation functions: Dubinin-Radushkevich
  (dr_plot) and Dubinin-Astakov (da_plot) plots.
* Added a new way to create an isotherm, from an two arrays of pressure
  and loading (the old DataFrame method is still valid but changed:
  check breaking changes).
* Made adsorbates searchable by a list of aliases rather than a single name.
* Exposed the CoolProp backend on adsorbate objects for convenience, it is
  accessible through the adsorbate.backend property.
* Streamlined the internal database functions.
* Updated NIST json import to new format.
  Cannot import multicomponent isotherms.
* Functions which generate matplotlib graphs now can take an Ax as parameter
  (similar to behaviour of pandas) to plot on existing figures.
* Changed behaviour of ModelIsotherm.guess function to accept a list of
  models to attempt to guess for.
* Added b-spline smoothing to output of dft fitting.

Breaking changes:

* The Sample class is now renamed as Material.
* Isotherm creation parameters have changed from 'sample_name', 'sample_batch'
  and 't_exp' to 'material_name', 'material_batch' and 't_iso'.
* Backend database has been simplified. Many required fields are no longer
  present and left to the discretion of the user.
* Several database functions have been renamed.
  All functions switched: 'sample' -> 'material' and 'experiment' -> 'isotherm'.
* When passing a DataFrame for isotherm creation, it now has to be specified as
  the parameter 'isotherm_data'.
* Isotherm unique ID is now generated on the fly (previously generated at
  each isotherm modification). It also now takes into account only the
  required parameters for each isotherm ( 'sample_name', 'sample_batch',
  't_exp' and 'adsorbate') as well as the model name, if the
  isotherm is a ModelIsotherm.
* Renamed Adsorbate.from_list() method to Adsorbate.find()

Bugfixes:

* Fixed issue in CSV import which read all values as strings (instead of floats/bools)
* Fixed an issue with Excel import of bools, as they were previously read as 1/0
* Fixed a bug where the automatic branch detection was not working when the
  DataFrame passed had a non-standard index.
* Fixed not being able to call _repr_ on an isotherm.


1.4.0 (2018-11-10)
------------------

New features:

* Added the GAB isotherm model

Bugfixes:

* Improved pore size distribution calculations to display cumulative pore
  volume when called.
* Fixed the "all-nol" selection parameter for legend display in isotherm
  graphs.

1.3.0 (2018-08-13)
------------------

New features:

* Added an excel import which can take Micromeritics or
  Belsorp report (.xls) files. Micromeritics code was
  taken from the `official python repo <https://github.com/Micromeritics/micromeritics>`_.
* Added an import option which can read and import Belsorp
  data (.DAT) files.
* Improved plotting functions to allow for more customisation
  over how the graph looks.
* The extra arguments to print_info() are now passed to the plotting
  function allowing for styles such as :issue:`8`.

Breaking changes:

* The unique isotherm ID is now generated only on a small subset of
  properties instead of all isotherm properties.
* The isotherm 'other_properties' subdictionary has been removed.
  Instead, all isotherm properties are now direct members of the
  class.
* When plotting, isotherm branches are now defined as 'ads', 'des'
  'all' (both branches) and 'all-nol' (both branches without
  legend entry) instead of a list of branches.
* Plot types are now universal. Any property can be plotted
  against any other property by specifying the x_data,
  y1_data and y2_data.

Bugfixes:

* Fixed 'source' not being recognised as an isotherm field
* Re-worked plot_iso color selection to avoid errors (:issue:`10`)
* Re-worked plot_isp legend placement to ensure no overlap
* Added correct common name for ethylene, propylene, methanol
  and ethanol in the database
* Renamed some model parameters for consistency
* A lot of typo fixes


1.2.0 (2018-02-19)
------------------

New features:

* The plotting legend now works with any isotherm attribute specified
* Changed model parent class to print out model name when displayed
* Added Toth and Jensen-Seaton models to the IAST calculation
  (spreading pressure is computed
  numerically using scipy.integrate.quad, :issue:`7`)

Bugfixes:

* Fixed an issue where the returned IAST selectivity v pressure
  data would not include all pressures
* Changed sqlite retrieval order to improve performance (:issue:`2`)
* Fixed an error where IAST vle data was plotted opposite to the graph axes
* Fixed a mistake in the Jensen-Seaton equation
* Fixed a mistake in the FH-VST equation

1.1.1 (2018-02-11)
------------------

New features:

* Allowed for branch selection for isosteric heat and fixed
  an error where this was an issue (:issue:`3`)

Bugfixes:

* Fixed an issue when plotting isotherms with and without
  secondary data simultaneously
* Fixed error with magnitude of polarizability of adsorbate
  from database in microporous PSD


1.1.0 (2018-01-24)
------------------

* Improved documentation

1.0.1 (2018-01-08)
------------------

* Fixed wrong value of polarizability for nitrogen in database
* Added a check for initial enthalpy when the isotherm is measured
  in supercritical mode

1.0.0 (2018-01-01)
------------------

* Improved unit management by adding a unit/basis for both the
  adsorbent (ex: amount adsorbed per g, kg or cm3 of material
  are all valid) and loading (ex: mmol, g, kg of gas adsorbed
  per amount of material are all valid)
* Separated isotherm models so that they can now be easily
  created by the used.
* Added new isotherm models: Toth, Jensen-Seaton, W-VST, FH-VST.
* Made creation of classes (Adsorbate/Sample/Isotherms) more
  intuitive.
* Many small fixes and improvements
