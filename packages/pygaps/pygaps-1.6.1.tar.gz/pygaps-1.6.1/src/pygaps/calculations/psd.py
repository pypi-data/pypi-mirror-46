    dict
        A dictionary with the pore widths and the pore distributions, of the form:

            - ``pore_widths`` (array) : the widths of the pores
            - ``pore_distribution`` (array) : contribution of each pore width to the
              overall pore distribution

    Notes
    -----
    Calculates the pore size distribution using a 'classical' model which attempts to
    describe the adsorption in a pore as a combination of a statistical thickness and
    a condensation/evaporation behaviour described by surface tension

    Currently, the methods provided are:

        - the BJH or Barrett, Joyner and Halenda method
        - the DH or Dollimore-Heal method, an extension of the BJH method

    A common mantra of data processing is: "garbage in = garbage out". Only use methods
    when you are aware of their limitations and shortcomings.

    According to Rouquerol [#]_, in adopting this approach, it is assumed that:

        - The Kelvin equation is applicable over the pore range (mesopores). Therefore
          in pores which are below a certain size (around 2.5 nm), the granularity
          of the liquid-vapour interface becomes too large for classical bulk methods
          to be applied.
        - The meniscus curvature is controlled be the pore size and shape. Ideal shapes
          for the curvature are assumed.
        - The pores are rigid and of well defined shape. They are considered
          open-ended and non-intersecting
        - The filling/emptying of each pore does not depend on its location.
        - The adsorption on the pore walls is not different from surface adsorption.

    *Description*

    Density Functional Theory (DFT) along with its extensions (NLDFT, QSDFT, etc)
    have emerged as the most powerful methods of describing adsorption on surfaces
    and in pores [#]_, [#]_. The theory allows the prediction of molecular behaviour solely
    on the basis of quantum mechanical considerations, and does not require other
    properties besides the electron structure and positions of the atoms involved.
    Calculations of large systems of atoms, such as those involved in adsorption
    in pores is a computationally intensive task, with modern computing power
    significantly improving the scales on which the modelling can be applied.

    The theory can be used to model adsorption in a simplified pore of a particular
    width which yields the the adsorption isotherm on a material comprised solely
    on pores of that width. The calculation is then repeated on pores of different
    sizes, to obtain a 'DFT kernel' or a collection of ideal isotherms on a
    distribution of pores. The generation of this kernel should be judicious, as
    both the adsorbent and the adsorbate must be modelled accurately. As it is a
    field in of in itself, the DFT calculations themselves are outside the scope
    of this program.

    Using the kernel, the isotherm obtained through experimental means can be
    modelled. The contributions of each kernel isotherm to the overall data is
    determined through a minimisation function. The contributions and their
    corresponding pore size form the pore size distribution of the material.

    The program accepts kernel files in a CSV format with the following structure:

    .. csv-table::
       :header: Pressure(bar), Pore size 1(nm), Pore size 2(nm), ..., Pore size y(nm)

        p1,l11,l21,...,ly1
        p2,l12,l22,...,ly2
        p3,l13,l23,...,ly3
        ...,...,...,...,...
        px,l1x,l2x,...,lyz

    The kernel should have sufficient points for a good interpolation as well as
    have a range of pressures that is wide enough to cover possible experimental
    values.

    *Limitations*

    The accuracy of predicting pore size through DFT kernels is only as good as
    the kernel itself, which should be tailored to the adsorbate, adsorbent and
    experimental conditions used.

    The isotherm used to calculate the pore size distribution should have enough
    datapoints and pressure range in order to cover adsorption in the entire range
    of pores the material has.
