Description: # interaction-grader
        Python package to help grade test questions (interactions) using trained machine learning models.
        
        The Answer class can be used to check if an answer is basically identical to the desired answer except 
        for misspellings.
        
        Initial version hard codes a model already trained to recognize actor names from a list of 322.
          
        ```Python
        import mmapi
        
        correct_answer = 'Joaquim Phoenix'
        answer = 'Joakim Pheonix'
        prediction = predict_actor(answer, correct_answer)  
        if prediction == correct_answer  
            print('Correct Answer')  
        ```
