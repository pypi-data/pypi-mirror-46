Hafnian
################################

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

The fastest exact hafnian library.

Features
========

* The fastest calculation of the hafnian, loop hafnian, permanent, and torontonian,
  of general and certain structured matrices.

* An easy to use interface to use the loop hafnian to calculate Fock matrix
  elements of Gaussian states via the included quantum module.

Getting started
===============

To get the Hafnian package installed and running on your system, begin at the :ref:`download and installation guide <installation>`. Then, familiarise yourself with some :ref:`background information on the Hafnian <hafnian>` and :ref:`the computational algorithm <algorithms>`.

For getting started with using the Hafnian library in your own code, have a look at the `Python tutorial <hafnian_tutorial.ipynb>`_.

Finally, detailed documentation on the code and API is provided.
