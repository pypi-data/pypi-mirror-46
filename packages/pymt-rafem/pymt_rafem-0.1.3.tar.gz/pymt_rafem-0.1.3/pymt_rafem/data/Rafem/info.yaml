summary: The River Avulsion and Floodplain Evolution Model (RAFEM) is
  a cellular model that simulates river and floodplain morphodynamics
  over large space and timescales. Cell size is larger than the channel
  belt width, and natural levees, which maintain a bankfull elevation
  above the channel bed, exist within a river cell. The river course is
  determined using a steepest-descent methodology, and erosion and deposition
  along the river profile are modeled as a linear diffusive process. An
  avulsion occurs when the riverbed becomes super-elevated relative to
  the surrounding floodplain, but only if the new steepest-descent path
  to sea level is shorter than the prior river course. If the new path to
  sea level is not shorter, then a crevasse splay is deposited in the
  adjacent river cells. The model has been designed to couple with the
  Coastline Evolution Model through the CSDMS Basic Model Interface.
