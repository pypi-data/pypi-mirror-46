=====================================


Introduction to OMEGAlpes
--------------------------

OMEGAlpes stands for Generation of Optimization Models As Linear Programming for Energy Systems.
It aims to be an energy systems modelling tool for linear optimisation (LP, MILP).
It is currently based on the LP modeler PuLP.

It is an Open Source project located on GitLab at https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/omegalpes/omegalpes
