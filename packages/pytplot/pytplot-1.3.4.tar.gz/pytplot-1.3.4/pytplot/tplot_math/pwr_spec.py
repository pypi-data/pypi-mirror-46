# First pass at the power spectrum function.  This is still missing several features of the IDL power spectrum routine, such as
# bin, nohanning, notperhertz, and tm_sensativity.  The IDL routine is located in dpwrspc.pro.

# There is also the issue of this not quite having the same units as the plot I use as my reference.

# Interestingly enough, the output is the same if units of seconds are used in the periodogram instead of Hertz.
# Perhaps they calculated it differently?
