# run just the bsub portion of the demand (for a single batch)
# The reason that the call to `sensitivity_demand_simulate` was extracted to it's own script is because the
# variable `$TMPDIR` is not set at the time `bsub` is called, only when the job is actually running on a node.
# (it might be possible to escape the variable somehow, I just haven't figured out how...)
