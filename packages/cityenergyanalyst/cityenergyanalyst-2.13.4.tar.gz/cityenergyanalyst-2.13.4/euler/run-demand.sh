# Submits the simulation jobs (calls to `cea/analysis/sensitivity/sensitivity_demand_simulate.py`) to the Euler job
# scheduler using the `bjobs` program. The simulation jobs are batched by the $NUM_SIMULATIONS variable in order
# to minimize the overhead of spinning up many jobs: Each job will simulate $NUM_SIMULATION jobs.
#
# In order to be able to use the `$TMPDIR` variable as the simulation folder, the job passed to `bjobs` is not the
# `sensitivity_demand_simulate.py` call, but instead `run-demand-bsub.sh`, which calls `sensitivity_demand_simulate.py`.
#
# See the documentation of `sensitivity_demand_simulate.py` for more information on the simulation script.
# Provides a handy interface using environment variables and default values tailored to the Euler cluster.
#
# Each parameter is set to the environment variable of the same name or the default value if not set.
# The samples folder is created if it doesn't yet exist.
# The --simulation-folder is set to $TMPDIR for the Euler scripts.

# This is the mapping of environment variables to argument names of the `sensitivity_demand_simulate.py` script:
#
# environment variable | corresponding argument
# N                    | (not used, except for calculating the default $SAMPLES_FOLDER value)
# METHOD               | --method
# SCENARIO             | --scenario
# SAMPLES_FOLDER       | --samples-folder
# WEATHER              | --weather
# NUM_SIMULATIONS      | --number-of-simulations
# OUTPUT_PARAMETERS    | FIXME: not implemented yet! --output-parameters
# VARIABLE_GROUPS      | FIXME: not implemented yet! --variable-groups
