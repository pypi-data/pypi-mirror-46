This guide provides information about the files generated by the CEA. The files generated by CEA are saved
in the following location ``<SCENARIO>\outputs\data``. In this folder, there are individual folders
corresponding to ``demand``, ``optimization``, ``potentials``, ``solar-radiation``, ``uncertainty``. These folders
are generated during every successful run corresponding to the function, i.e. ``demand`` folder is generated
when ``CityEnergyAnalyst\cea\demand\demand_main.py`` file is run.

The variable ``<SCENARIO>`` is used throughout this document to reference the path to a CEA scenario folder, e.g. the
folder ``baseline`` in the sample reference case shipped with the CEA.

The variable ``<BUILDINGNAME>``  is used throughout this document to reference the name of a single building in the
scenario.

``El_sys_W``        :   End-use demand of electricity required for lighting including system losses (in Watts)

``El_W``            :   End-use demand of electricity required for lighting without system losses (in Watts)

``ET_sys_MWhyr``    :   Total end-use demand of electricity required including system losses (in MWh per year)


``Qww_PVT_DIRECT_MWhyr``    :   Heat generated by PVT supplied to the directload of hot water demand (MWhyr)

``ET_PV_GRID_MWhyr``        :   Total electricity generated by PV which is supplied to the local power grid (MWhyr)


``Capex_A_Fix_CCGT_MUSD``   :   Annualized CAPEX (fixed component) for CCGT equipment (in million USD)

``Opex_T_Var_FC_USD``       :   Total OPEX (variable component) of FC equipment (in USD)


``NG_used_HPSew_W``         :   Natural gas used by sewage heat pump (in Watts)

``Wood_used_Furnace_W``     :   Wood used by Furnace (in Watts)


``GHG_PVT_tonCO2``          :   Green house gas emissions of PVT (in tons of CO2 equivalent)
