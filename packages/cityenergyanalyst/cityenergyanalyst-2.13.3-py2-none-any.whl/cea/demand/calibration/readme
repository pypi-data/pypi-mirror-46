
Description:

the bayesian calibrator consists of 4 scripts called in the following order.
- cea/demand/calibration/calibration_sampling.py
- cea/demand/calibration/calibration_gaussian_emulator.py
- cea/demand/calibration/calibration_main.py

Inputs:
Default variables can be changed in the settings.py file

In calibration_sampling.py the inputs are:
    variables = ['U_win', 'U_wall', 'n50', 'Ths_set_C', 'Cm_Af']  #note: it needs to be 5 variables selected from
                                                                  #the database cea/databases/uncertainty/uncertainty/dist.
    building_name = 'B01'       #note: it needs to be one building at the time selected form zone.shp
    building_load = 'Qhsf_kWh' - #note: it should be one of the loads possible selected from the list of possible output variables
                                 #of the demand script. there is a global variable storing that.

In calibration_gaussian_emulator.py
    building_name = 'B01'       #note: it needs to be the same previous building


In calibration_main.py
    building_name = 'B01'       #note: it needs to be the same previous building
