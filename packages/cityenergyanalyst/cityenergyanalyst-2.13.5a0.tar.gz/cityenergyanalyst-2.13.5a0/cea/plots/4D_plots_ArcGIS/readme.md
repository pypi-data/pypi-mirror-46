5.	Do right click on the default.gdb and do import table single. Go there and import the  4D_plot database we generated from python. Give it a name of more than 5 characters.
6.	Drag the newly imported zone geometry file to the scene.
7.	Right click in the zone layer go and create a join to the newly imported table. Do the join on building name.
