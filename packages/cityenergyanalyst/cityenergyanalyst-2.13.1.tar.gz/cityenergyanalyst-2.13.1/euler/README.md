# Running the sensitivity analysis on the Euler cluster

**NOTE**: You need to be an ETH Zurich affiliated person and own a nethz-account for access to the Euler cluster.

This guide shows you how to run the sensitivity analysis for the demand simulations on the Euler cluster. 
The Euler cluster is a high performance computing (HPC) cluster that uses the IBM Load Sharing Facility (LSF) 
batch system. If your cluster is similar, maybe this guide can also work for you or provide some hints on how to
get it to work...

## Installation

See the contributor's manual for information on installing the software on Euler

## Main workflow

These are the steps to be performed for running the demand sensitivity analysis:

- create a set of "samples" in the samples folder inside euler, i. e. a set of parameter configurations that are to be
 simulated.
- run a demand simulation for each sample and store the output to the samples folder
  - copy the reference case folder to the simulation folder
  - apply sample parameters to the reference case
- merge the output data back to a single dataset
- run analysis on the output data, generating the output file "analysis.xls" in the samples folder

## File locations

The bash scripts make some assumptions on the installation of the CEA:

- the CityEnergyAnalyst repository is cloned to `$HOME/CityEnergyAnalyst`
- the default reference case is found in `$HOME/cea-reference-case/reference-case-open/baseline`
  - note: since git-lfs is not installed on Euler, you will need to manually copy the radiation files to the cluster 
    (`radiation.csv`, `properties_surfaces.csv`)


The Euler cluster has [different filesystems](https://scicomp.ethz.ch/wiki/Data_management) for different purposes. 
Due to the way the simulation tasks are split up, the simulation uses the following folders:

- the reference case (`--scenario-path`) is used as a copy of the original reference case - each 
  sample is created from this case as a copy. You can keep the reference case anywhere you like in your 
  home folder or personal scratch storage.
  - home folder: `/cluster/home/username` (backed up, permanent, alias: `$HOME`)
  - personal scratch storage: `/cluster/scratch/username` (not backed up, deleted after 15 days, alias: `$SCRATCH`)
  
- the weather path: the path to the *.epw file used for simulation. This can be kept in the home folder.
    - the default weather file used by the bash scripts is `$HOME/CityEnergyAnalyst/cea/databases/weather/Zurich.epw`
  
- the samples folder contains the inputs (list of samples and the problem statement) and the final outputs of the
  analysis. This should be stored in your personal scratch folder (as the home folder has a limit to 100k files).
    - the samples folder used by the bash scripts is `${SCRATCH}/samples_${METHOD}_${N}` (e.g. 
      `/cluster/scratch/darthoma/samples_morris_100`)    
  
- the simulation reference case is a copy of the original reference case with the variables from the sampling method
  applied to the input data. This folder is created by the demand simulation script and is stored in the local
  scratch folder of the node running the demand simulation.
  - local scratch storage: `/scratch` 
  - (actually, the bash scripts use the `$TMPDIR` variable to ensure simultaneous simulations on the same node don't step on 
    each other's feet)
    
## Running the scripts

There are two ways to run the scripts. The first way is with the python modules as shown for the Windows case. On
Euler, the scripts in the `euler` folder of the `CityEnergyAnalyst` repository contains a set of handy bash scripts that
simplify running the scripts.

### On Windows

Here is an example of running the scripts on windows. Replace paths according to your setup.

The above steps run morris sampling (the default) with N=1, and num_levels=4 (default), simulates
all the samples and stores the results back into the sampling directory.

On the Euler cluster, we can set N to a much higher number, say, 1000 and we would then
run `sensitivity_demand_simulate` multiple times, incrementing the `--sample-index`
parameter by `--number-of-simulations` each time. We need to choose `--number-of-simulations`
to fit the simulation count in the time slot of the node as the Euler cluster will kill
any process that runs longer than a fixed amount of time. Keeping it as large as possible
reduces the overhead of waiting for a node to pick up the job, so we will need to
experiment a bit here... The bash scripts for the euler cluster do this automatically and have a batch size of 100,
which works well for the `reference-case-open`.

The next step is to run the analysis on the results. This is done in a single process.

```
[esri104] darthoma@ITA-SCHLUE-W-17 C:\Users\darthoma\Documents\GitHub\CityEnergyAnalyst
> python cea\analysis\sensitivity\sensitivity_demand_analyze.py --samples-folder %TEMP%\samples
```

### Running on Euler

- I cloned the reference case project to my home folder.
- I copied the `radiation.csv` and `properties_surfaces.csv` files to the `reference-case-open` 
  [using scp](ethz).

```
# on windows
[esri104] C:\reference-case-open\baseline\outputs\data\solar-radiation>scp radiation.csv darthoma@euler.ethz.ch:~/cea-reference-case/reference-case-open/baseline/outputs/data/solar-radiation
[esri104] C:\reference-case-open\baseline\outputs\data\solar-radiation>scp properties_surfaces.csv darthoma@euler.ethz.ch:~/cea-reference-case/reference-case-open/baseline/outputs/data/solar-radiation
```

#### Run the data helper script:

```
[darthoma@euler05 ~]$ python -m cea.datamanagement.data_helper -s /cluster/home/darthoma/cea-reference-case/reference -case-open/baseline/
```

#### Create the samples

To create the samples, you need to set up the parameters of the analysis first. These are used by the three scripts 
`create-samples.sh`, `run-demand.sh` and `analyze-simulations.sh` bash scripts found in the euler folder 
(`$HOME/CityEnergyAnalyst/euler`):

```
[darthoma@euler05 ~]$ export N=10
[darthoma@euler05 ~]$ export METHOD=morris
[darthoma@euler05 ~]$ sh CityEnergyAnalyst/euler/create-samples.sh
created 12 samples in /cluster/scratch/darthoma/samples_morris_1
```

Check the scripts for a list of valid variables to export. They refer to the input parameters to the python scripts,
but are uppercase and with underscores.

When choosing your variables to analyze and the number of samples to be created, keep in mind that the maximum number of files Euler can store in your scratch folder is one million. By default, the number of files created by the sensitivity analysis is equal to the number of samples times the number of buildings to be simulated plus one.

#### Run the simulations

```
[darthoma@euler05 ~]$ sh CityEnergyAnalyst/euler/run-demand.sh
Generic job.
Job <31205729> is submitted to queue <normal.4h>.
```

This sets up the demand calculation to run in batch mode. You can use the command `bjobs` to view the list of jobs
still open - read up in the [Euler wiki](https://scicomp.ethz.ch/wiki/Using_the_batch_system) on how that works.
The variable `NUM_SIMULATIONS` (default: 100) determines how many samples are simulated per job. When choosing the number of simulations, keep in mind that the run-time limit for a job on Euler is 4 hours.

Wait for all the jobs to complete by checking `bjobs` until there are no more jobs in the queue. You can use this command to see how many simulations a job batch has done (`31300468` is the jobid, get that from `bjobs` or `bbjobs`):

```
bpeek 31300468 | grep elapsed | wc
```

#### Analyze the output

Assuming you still have the same variables exported as you had when you ran the samples script:

```
[darthoma@euler05 ~]$ sh euler/analyze-simulations.sh
```

This will produce the file `analysis.xls` in the samples folder. Use `scp` to copy that back to your windows machine:

```
# on windows
[esri104] C:\Users\darthoma\Dropbox\tmp>scp darthoma@euler.ethz.ch:/cluster/scratch/darthoma/samples_sobol_100/analysis.xls analysis_sobol_100.xls
```

(Replace with your actual paths and username)

I'm leaving this for another day...
