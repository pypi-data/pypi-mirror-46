Description: # __Limitloop__
        
        Limitloop is a lightweight python module for running loops that depend on precise timing.
        
        This package is available through Pypi and can be installed with the following command.
        
        ```sh
        python -m pip install limitloop
        ```
        
        ## Basic usage
        
        All functionality of the module is provided through the `limitloop.Loop` class. This class is instantiated with a reference to a function, which it can then call at a consistent rate a preset number of times, or until otherwise interrupted. For example, the following code...
        
        ```python
        from limitloop import Loop
        
        #Define a simple function for the Loop object to call
        #This function must accept the loop object itself as its first argument
        def demoFunction(loop):
            print('Hello, world!')
        
        #Create our loop object, set to run at one iteration per second
        l = Loop(demoFunction, freq=1)
        #Call the function defined above 5 times
        l.run(5)
        ```
        ...will output the following, one line per second.
        ```
        Hello, world!
        Hello, world!
        Hello, world!
        Hello, world!
        Hello, world!
        ```
        See the [API reference](api_reference.md) for more advanced usage.
