        Automatic Check In And Out
        ==========================
        |PyPI version|
        
        `auto-check` is a tool used to check in & out in the remote server automaticly. Set a crontab task that run this script in the remote linux system.The check in & out system was a little bit funny, because this api(url)'s network package was captured while using my iPhone App to perform check in & out actions, and I check in & out successfully via these api with cookies, etc.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        `pip3 install auto-check`
        
        Usage
        -----
        The following setting will perform an action that `cio.py` was executed at 8:30 and 19:30 on every workday.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            30 8,19 * * * auto-check
        
        FAQ
        ---
        - Why performs login aciton before check in & out?
        
          In order to avoid the cookies being out of date, though that case didn't appear. But when I open the iPhone App, the lonin action was performed, and the latest cookie was received by the App.
