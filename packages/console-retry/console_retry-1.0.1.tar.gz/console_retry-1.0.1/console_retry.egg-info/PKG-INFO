Description: # console-retry
        
        This utility is designed to run any shell command and retry if no new line was written to 
        stdout within a specified timeout
        
        The default timeout applies to lines written to stdout of the shell command. 
        
        Retry is triggered when:
        * No new line was written to stdout after specified timeout
        
        Retry is not triggered when:
        * The command as a whole takes longer than specified timeout
        * The command returns a non-zero (error) return code
        
        To be a good bash-citizen the return code is mirrors the return code of the subcommand or 1 if the command never 
        finished in the specified timeout.
