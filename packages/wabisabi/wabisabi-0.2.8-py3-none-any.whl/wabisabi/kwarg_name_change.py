As this library is still in early development, the API might change.
I suggest you vendor this so that you don't create conflicts if other
libraries decide to use an older, incompatible version

If you are shipping python source code, then I've included the license

    If the current library version is smaller than version in which the new
    signature takes effect, this deprecator will:

    Issue a warnign pointing to the user's code if they call a function with
    too many positional arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    version: version-like
        Version in which the new function signature takes full effect.

    previous_kwarg_map: dictionary of kwarg name maps
        This dictionary contains the keys (the old kwarg names) and the
        associated values of the new kwarg names. You may specifiy as
        many kwarg name pairs as you wish.

    library_name: str
        Friendly library name to include in warning messages

    current_library_version: version-like
        The current version of the shipped library (typically your module's
        ``__version__``).
