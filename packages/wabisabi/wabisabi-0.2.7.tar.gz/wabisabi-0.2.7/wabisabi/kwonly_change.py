    """Returns a decorator that enforces a smaller number of positional arguments.

    If the current library version is smaller than version in which the new
    signature takes effect, this deprecator will:

    Issue a warnign pointing to the user's code if they call a function with
    too many positional arguments.

    If you want to move the new keyword only arguments after the keyword
    only seperator, you should specify a list with the previous order of
    arguments as the parameter ``previous_arg_order``. If this parameter is
    not specified, it is assumed that the previous function signature allowed
    all parameters to be specified as either positional or keyword arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    version: version-like
        Version in which the new function signature takes full effect.

    previous_arg_order: list of strings or ``None``
        If the function previously had keyword only arguments, you should use
        this to specify the names of previous positional arguments. If set
        to none, it is assumed that the previous version of the function
        would accept all parameters as positional or keyword arguments.
        Specifying this also allows you to re-order the new keyword only.
        To re-iterate, you cannot swap the order of positional arguments with
        this deprecator.

    keep_old_signature: bool
        If set to true, the signature will reflect the previous signature of
        the function. This is not recommended since showing new users the
        keyword-only version of the signature will not cause them to write
        wrong code. If they follow the new signature, their code will be
        correct and they will avoid the ``FutureWarning``.

    library_name: str
        Friendly library name to include in warning messages

    current_library_version: version-like
        The current version of the shipped library (typically your module's
        ``__version__``).
