1. A fracturing system comprising: a turbine generator having an electrical output; an electric motor that is in electrical communication with the electrical output; a fracturing pump that is driven by the electric motor; and a wireline system that is in electrical communication with the electrical output.</claim-text><claim-text>2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a variable frequency drive connected to the electric motor to control the speed of the motor, wherein the variable frequency drive frequently performs electric motor diagnostics to prevent damage to the at least one electric motor.</claim-text><claim-text>3. The system of claim 1, wherein the wireline system comprises a wireline tool that is disposable in a wellbore that is selected from the group consisting of a perforating gun, a plug, a formation logging tool, a cutting tool, a casing imaging tool, and combinations thereof.</claim-text><claim-text>4. The system of claim 1, further comprising trailers that contain at least one power distribution panel that supplies power to the hydraulic fracturing equipment.</claim-text><claim-text>5. The system of claim 4, where the trailers further contain receptacles for attaching cable to the hydraulic fracturing equipment and cables that can sustain the power draw of the turbines with three separate plugs for the three phase power.</claim-text><claim-text>6. The system of claim 1, wherein at least one weatherproofed switchgear is connected to the at least one turbine and includes at least one air conditioner, external deck, walkway, and vacuum circuit breaker. </claim-text><claim-text>7. The system of claim 1, further comprising a trailer having a 3500 KVA transformer which steps the 13.8 kV power from the turbines down to 600 V for use by the hydraulic fracturing equipment.</claim-text><claim-text>8. The system of claim 1, further comprising a variable frequency drive that supplies power and controls a Blender Discharge Motor, where the Blender Discharge Motor is speed controlled.</claim-text><claim-text>9. The system of claim 1, further comprising a Power Control Room that contains electric motor soft starters that supply power to a Blender Hydraulic Motor, a Hydration unit Hydraulic Motor, Blender Blower Motors, and a Hydration unit Blower Motors.</claim-text><claim-text>10. A method for providing electric power to hydraulic fracturing equipment in a fracturing operation, the method including the steps of: driving a fracturing pump with an electrically powered motor; regulating a speed of the motor with a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD); and providing electrical power to a wireline system.</claim-text><claim-text>11. The method of claim 10 further including the step of creating at least one separate power grid using at least one auxiliary trailer.</claim-text><claim-text>12. The method of claim 10, further including the step of monitoring the power generation through the at least one auxiliary trailer for the fracturing equipment and providing an emergency shut-off switch.</claim-text><claim-text>13. The method of claim 10, further including the step of stepping with at least one transformer the electricity to the needed voltage from the at least one natural gas turbine generator.</claim-text><claim-text>14. The method of claim 10, further including the step of attaching cables that can  sustain the power draw of the turbines with three separate plugs for the three phase power to receptacles on the hydraulic fracturing equipment from the at least one trailer.</claim-text><claim-text>15. The method of claim 10 further including the step of supplying power with at least one power distribution panel and a variable frequency drive to the hydraulic fracturing equipment.</claim-text><claim-text>16. The method of claim 10 further including the step of generating three- phase power from at least one natural gas powered turbine generator;</claim-text><claim-text>17. The method of claim 10 further including the step of regulating power through the use of at least one switchgear that is connected to the at least one turbine generator and includes at least one air conditioner, external deck, walkway, and vacuum circuit breaker;</claim-text><claim-text>18. The method of claim 10, further comprising detonating shaped charged in the perforating system using power provided from the auxiliary trailer.</claim-text><claim-text>19. The method of claim 10, wherein the at least one trailer contains a 3500KVA transformer which steps the 13.8kV power from the turbines down to 600V for use by the fracturing equipment.</claim-text><claim-text>20. The method of claim 10, further including the step of selecting from the list consisting of a natural gas powered turbine on the trailer and power supplied by a third party.</claim-text><claim-text>21. The method of claim 10, wherein the wireline system is selected from the group consisting of a perforating system, a plugging system, a formation logging system, a tubular cutting system, a tubular imaging system, and combinations thereof. </claim-text></claim></claims></ftxt:fulltext-document></ftxt:fulltext-documents></ops:world-patent-data>
