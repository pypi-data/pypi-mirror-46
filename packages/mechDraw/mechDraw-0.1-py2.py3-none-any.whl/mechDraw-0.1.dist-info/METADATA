mechDraw is a simple Python drawing library built on matplotlib modeled after the TikZ LaTeX API. It is meant primarily for mechanics drawings used in gitMechanics. It is currently in the experimentation stages. This is created to be an ideal programatic drawing library used inside Jupyter Notebooks.
