      name: Validate the Heat environment file for network configuration
      description: >
        This validates the network environment and nic-config files
        that specify the overcloud network configuration and are stored
        in the current plan's Swift container.

        The deployers are expected to write these files themselves as
        described in the Network Isolation guide:

        http://tripleo.org/advanced_deployment/network_isolation.html
      groups:
        - pre-deployment
    network_environment_path: environments/network-environment.yaml
  tasks:
  - name: Validate the network environment files
    network_environment:
      path: "{{ network_environment_path }}"
      template_files: "{{ lookup('tht') }}"
