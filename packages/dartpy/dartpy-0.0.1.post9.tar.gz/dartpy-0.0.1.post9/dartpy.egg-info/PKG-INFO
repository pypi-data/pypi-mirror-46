Description: 
            dartpy is the Python API of DART (Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit).
        
            The library provides data structures and algorithms for kinematic and
            dynamic applications in robotics and computer animation. DART is
            distinguished by its accuracy and stability due to its use of generalized
            coordinates to represent articulated rigid body systems and Featherstoneâ€™s
            Articulated Body Algorithm to compute the dynamics of motion. For
            developers, in contrast to many popular physics engines which view the
            simulator as a black box, DART gives full access to internal kinematic and
            dynamic quantities, such as the mass matrix, Coriolis and centrifugal
            forces, transformation matrices and their derivatives. DART also provides
            an efficient computation of Jacobian matrices for arbitrary body points and
            coordinate frames.
