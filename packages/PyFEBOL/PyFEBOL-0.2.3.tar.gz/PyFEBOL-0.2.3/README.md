# PyFEBOL

A Python rewrite of the [https://github.com/dressel/FEBOL.jl](FEBOL.jl) by Louis Dressel.
It aims to also be a general framework for simulating UAV-based localization of a single target. 
The user can choose from a variety of sensors, filters, and policies (or make his own).
The package was created to better interface with reinforcement learning packages created in Python.

## Installation

```
pip install PyFEBOL
