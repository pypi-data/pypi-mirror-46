[AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming) is based on getting information from a server and updating a single piece of the html without reloading the entire page and [JQUERY](http://jquery.com/) is about making the selection of tags easier and more consistent with the CSS syntax. Other JavaScript libraries that are popular are [Bootstrap][bs] (about layout and buttons etc), [React.js][react] (some extra tools for making user interfaces), [Angular][Angular] (helps in web apps).
