Description: pyMez is a python package born out of the daily needs of a laboratory scientist. In particular, there is a constant need to use external equipment to acquire data, store that data in a sensible way, analyze the stored data, and generate collections and reports after analyzing the data. In the world of scientific computation there is an endless universe of solutions to do this, however none of the solutions met my personal daily needs and philosophy simultaneously. This package tries to stitch together many tools to meet those needs, while serving as a backend library to a webserver. It thus has many dependencies. Some of the dependencies are os specific, however the lack of them should not prevent operation. Although it currently has a single primary developer, it is my hope that it will be adopted by at least 10's of people and help them accomplish their daily scientific goals.
