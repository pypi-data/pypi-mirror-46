The uncalibrated s-parameters of these standards are measured using a modified version of the HP Basic program MultiCAL. The data is saved to temp files that are overwritten each time. The setup is predefined by the internal software modifcations and the user is required to enter some data as to the line lengths. Once the calibration set is measured a series of correction coefficients is calculated and written to the VNA (or PNA) using MultiCAL. MultiCAL uses the LRL calibration method. Internal to MultiCAL are several checks to see if the calibration looks as expected. If the calibration looks strange to the user then the process is repeated or lines are dropped from the LRL calibration.     \n",

    "A set of internally maintained check standards that are normally composed of a attenuator, high reflect, and/or a load are chosen and measured using repeated connects (typically 3 by convention) and potentially a reversal of device direction. These are measured using the HP Basic Program MeasLP (or a modified version) with the VNA in a calibrated state. The data from each of these measurements are stored in the HP Binary format known as BDAT with file extensions that represent the date, system used and an itterator. Currently the files are written to common location that is chosen in the MeasLP program. The data is then loaded to the HP Basic Program Calrep. Calrep assigns errors and given a file directory compares the data to a previously calculated standard curve saved as a result file (Ascii) in common folder. This comparision along with some of the calculated errors are then used as a series of graphical comparisions for the user to determine if the calibration and machine state is sufficently good to procede to the DUT. The raw data in BDAT format is retained, but it is atypical to output the analyzed results to a file at this point.       \n",

    "We would prefer given a file that defines the check standards to be measured, the check standard defintions would be automatically filled out and measured with a single program. In addition, the raw measurements should be stored in a recoverable manner so that the check standard could be calculated using different methods in post processing (the raw measurements should be stored without the calibration correction). The comparision of the check standard s-parameters with the accepted curve should be achieved through calculation using the previous history of the device and/or a single definition file. In addition, the measurement history of each of the check standards should be findable to determine if the check standards have changed through time. This is the step that the Chech Standard Database project was desgined to streamline and assist. Currently, we have ~20-30 years of measurements of these check standard measurements in BDAT format and the Standard Curve for comparision was calculated using a SAS program in the early 2000's. The standard curve is saved in a folder on a shared drive and accessed with the Calrep program.   \n",
