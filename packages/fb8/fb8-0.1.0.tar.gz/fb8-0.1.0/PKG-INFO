Description: sphere
        =================
        
        Implments the FB8 distribution on a sphere, which is a generalization of the FB6, FB5 (Kent), and FB4 (Bingham-Mardia) distributions described below.
        
        Implements the FB6 distribution that is first introduced in Rivest ([1984](https://www.doi.org/10.1214/aos/1176346724)).
        
        Implements calculation of the density and fitting (using maximum likelihood estimate) of the Kent distribution based on Kent ([1982](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1982.tb01189.x)). A unittest is performed if distribution.py is called from the command line.
        
        Implements the Bingham-Mardia distribution whose mode is a small-circle on the sphere based on Bingham, Mardia ([1978](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/65.2.379)).
        
        Also calculates directional, percentile contours which can be used to indicate the N% highest-posterior-density regions in the sky.
