class Flasher:
    """Creates smooth window flash animations.

    If a flash is requested on an already flashing window, the first request is
    restarted and the second request is ignored. This ensures that Flasher
    threads do not try to draw to the same window at the same time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time: float
        Flash interval in milliseconds
    flash_opacity: float
        Flash opacity as a decimal between 0 and 1
    default_opacity: float
        Default opacity for windows as a decimal between 0 and 1. Windows are
        restored to this opacity after a flash.
    ntimepoints: int
        Number of timepoints in the flash animation. Higher values will lead to
        smoother animations at the cost of increased X server requests.
        Ignored if simple is True.
    simple: bool
        If True, don't animate flashes. Setting this parameter improves
        performance but causes rougher opacity transitions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    flash_series: List[float]
        The series of opacity transitions during a flash.
    progress: Dict[int, int]
        Keys are window ids for windows that are currently being flashed. Values
        are indices in the flash_series which define the progress in the flash
        animation.
    timechunk: float
        Number of seconds between opacity transitions.
