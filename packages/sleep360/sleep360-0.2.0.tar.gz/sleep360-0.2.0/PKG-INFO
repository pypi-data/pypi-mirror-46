Description: # Sleep360
        
        This project allows to control the Holi SleepCompanion from a Linux computer.
        
        The SleepCompanion is nice LED bulb that offers a lot of features to improve your sleep and your waking up.
        It is manufactured by Holi, a French company.
        A product description can be found by following these links:

        - [An English overview](https://www.hobbr.com/holi-sleep-companion)
        
        This Sleep360 project is written in Python and can be used:
        
        - as a library by creating a `sleep360.Bulb()` object
        - as a command line utility (coming soon)
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - D-BUS
        - bluez >= 5.46 (dependency on the GATT D-BUS API)
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### From PyPI
        
            pip install [--user] sleep360
        
        ### From the sources
        
            cd python-sleep360
            pip install [--user] .
        
        ## Command line usage
        
        `pip install` installs a `sleep360` binary.
        Running it gives a prompt like this one:
        
            Sleep360 shell (version x.y.z).
            Type help or ? to list commands.
        
            [sleep360] connect Bulb
            Connecting to the Bulb...
            [sleep360] set_color 0xff0000 0x00 0x00
            [sleep360] disconnect
            Disconnecting from the Bulb...
            [sleep360] exit
        
        ## Library usage
        
            bulb = Bulb(name="Bulb")
            bulb.connect()
        
            # Play with bulb commands
            [...]
        
            bulb.disconnect()
        
        Examples are available in the [tests](tests) directory.
        
        ## Supported features
        
        The SleepCompanion bulb offers a lot of features.
        Among them, the following ones are currently supported by Sleep360:
        
        - Setting colors (RGB + warm and cold value)
        - Powering off the light
        - Getting the temperatures measured by the bulb
        
        ## Reverse-engineering
        
        This project has been developed by carefully studying the Bluetooth LE messages.
        The file [BLE-protocol.md](BLE-protocol.md) describes my understanding of these messages.
