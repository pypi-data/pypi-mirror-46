Description: # Sleep360
        
        This project allows to control the Holi SleepCompanion from a Linux computer.
        
        The SleepCompanion is nice LED bulb that offers a lot of features to improve your sleep and your waking up.

        - [An English overview](https://www.hobbr.com/holi-sleep-companion)
        
        This Sleep360 project is written in Python and can be used:
        
        - as a library by creating a `sleep360.Bulb()` object
        - as a command line utility (coming soon)
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - D-BUS
        - bluez >= 5.46 (dependency on the GATT D-BUS API)

        ## Supported features
        
        The SleepCompanion bulb offers a lot of features.
        Among them, the following ones are currently supported by Sleep360:
        
        - Setting colors (RGB + warm and cold value)
        - Powering off the bulb
        
        ## Reverse-engineering
        
        This project has been developed by carefully studying the Bluetooth LE messages.
        The file [BLE-protocol.md](BLE-protocol.md) describes my understanding of these messages.
