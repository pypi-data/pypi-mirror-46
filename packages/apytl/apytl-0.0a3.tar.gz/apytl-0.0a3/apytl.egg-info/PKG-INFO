Description: # Another Python Terminal Logger
        
        Here it is: another python terminal logger---apytl.
        
        # Installation
        
        I've attempted to make this easy. You should be abple to use `pip` to install 
        the package by running:
        
        ```console
        pip install apytl
        ```
        
        You may also install from source. You may either download the files from PyPI by 
        following the `Download files` link on the package homepage, or you may clone 
        the git repository:
        
        ```console
        git clone https://github.com/anadolski/apytl.git
        ```
        
        If this is the first time you're installing the package, all you should need to 
        do is `cd` to the source directory (i.e., the one containing `setup.py`) and 
        run:
        
        ```console
        python setup.py build
        python setup.py install --user --record ./.installed_files.txt
        ```
        
        If you re-clone the repo (or `git pull` or otherwise update the source code), 
        you will need to reinstall to take advantage of all the fun new features. And 
        bugs. Let's not forget those bugs. To reinstall---again, from the source 
        directory---run:
        
        ```console
        rm $(cat ./.installed_files.txt)
        ```
        
        This command will attempt to delete every entry in `.installed_files.txt`, so 
        use with caution.
        
        To reinstall, simply run the `build` and `install` commands mentioned at the 
        beginning of the section.
