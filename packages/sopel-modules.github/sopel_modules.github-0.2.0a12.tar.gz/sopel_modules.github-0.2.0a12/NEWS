Changes in 0.2.0a12
===================

Changes in 0.2.0a11

Changes in 0.2.0a10
===================

Added:

Changes in 0.2.0a9
==================

Changed:
* URL regexes should be more faithful to GitHub's actual restrictions
  * Neither usernames nor repo names can contain underscore (`_`), so we
    shouldn't accept it
  * Repo names can contain dot (`.`), which the old regex didn't allow
  * Usernames have a maximum length, which we are now looking for

Fixed:
* Unnecessary parentheses added in previous alpha release
  * Apparently, `pip install --upgrade --pre` can install the wrong release,
    making one's testing unreliable.


Changes in 0.2.0a8
==================

Fixed:
* Developer stupidity regarding inline conditionals


Changes in 0.2.0a7
==================

Fixed:
* Developer stupidity regarding types


Changes in 0.2.0a6
==================

Changed:
* Handler for commit links now outputs "1 file" instead of "1 files" if the
  linked commit changed only one file


Changes in 0.2.0a5
==================

Added:
* Webhook handling of draft pull requests (both opening and marking ready)

Fixed:
* Sopel's development version finally marked `SopelMemory.contains()` as
  deprecated, so we don't use it any more


Changes in 0.2.0a4
==================

Fixed:
* Empty PR reviews caused HTTP 500 because of how they were skipped (they
  should now return HTTP 200 as normal)


Changes in 0.2.0a3
==================

Added:
* Handle when issues/PRs are "reopened" (#27)


Changes in 0.2.0a2
==================

Fixed:
* Polymorphism is hard in label/assignee events (getting the PR number caused
  errors because sometimes GitHub *does* use `pull_request` instead of `issue`)


Changes in 0.2.0a1
==================

Added:
* Handle label & assignee events for PRs too, not just issues (#23)

Changed:
* Edits to review comments also ignored (#24)


Changes in 0.2.0a0
==================

Added:
* Conversion of :emoji: to Unicode emoji in some places, if the required
  library is installed (#17)
* Handling of PR reviews and release events (#20, #21)

Changed:
* Merged PRs are now distinct from closed PRs (#18)
* Grammar updated, mostly around comment-type notifications (#15)
* Edits to existing comments are ignored (no more duplicates) (#16)


Changes in 0.1.5
================

Fixed:
* Refactoring unintentionally broke registering new repo webhooks (#14)

Meta:
* PyPI package description should be rendered to HTML now (fixed content-type)


Changes in 0.1.4
================

Changed:
* "GitHub" is now properly capitalized everywhere in text output. (#9)
* Usage output uses `help_prefix` from config instead of hardcoded `.` (#12)

Fixed:
* git.io shortening was cutting off GET parameters of input links. (#11)


Changes in 0.1.3
================

Meta:
* Moved to Sopel organization on Github; new maintainer.

Changed:
* Uses requests instead of deprecated sopel.web functions. (Sopel itself
  requires requests, so we don't have to.)
* Fetched git.io links use HTTPS now.
