Description: # Structured Scopes
        
        [View the documentation](https://ahopkins.github.io/structured-scopes/) to learn more.
        
        ## Abstract
        
        This is an abstract specification for the use of structured scopes in permission granting utilities.
        
        ## Introduction
        
        The goal of this endeavor is to standardize and define the meaning, and usage of "scopes" for implementation in an authorization utility. It is [licensed](https://github.com/ahopkins/structured-scopes/blob/master/LICENSE) under the [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)

        ## Purpose
        
        The purpose of "scoping" is to provide a pass/fail response to a request for permission on a defined resource to authorized clients having the requisite permission level. A common application would be for permissioning on protected resources, for example, on web requests.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```
        pip install sscopes
        ```
        
        ## Brief
        
        Examples in brief:
        
        ```
        Base:       user
        Inbound:    foobar
        Result:     fail
        
        
        Base:       user
        Inbound:    user
        Result:     pass
        
        
        Base:       user:write
        Inbound:    user
        Result:     pass
        
        
        Base:       user:write
        Inbound:    user:read
        Result:     fail
        ```
