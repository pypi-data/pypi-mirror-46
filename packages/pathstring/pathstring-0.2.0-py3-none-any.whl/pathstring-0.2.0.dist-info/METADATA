Description-Content-Type: text/x-rst

pathstring is a very small module that provides a string class
which supports path operations. Technically, it subclasses ``str``
and delegates path related operations to ``pathlib.Path``.

Differences from pathlib paths are:

- Paths are strings, no need to cast them to strings.

- It adds a ``path.rmtree()`` operation which invokes ``shutil.rmtree``.
  Actually, since paths are strings, ``shutil.rmtree(path)`` will also work.

- It adds a ``strict`` parameter to the ``relative_to`` operation
  which, when set to ``False``, will also navigate up in the hierarchy.

- It doesn't support the slash operator for joining paths.
