        ## Introduction
        SPGL1 is a solver for large-scale one-norm
        regularized least squares.
        
        It is designed to solve any of the following three problems:
        
        1. Basis pursuit denoise (BPDN):
           ``minimize  ||x||_1  subject to  ||Ax - b||_2 <= sigma``,
        
        2. Basis pursuit (BP):
           ``minimize   ||x||_1  subject to  Ax = b``
         
        3. Lasso:
           ``minimize  ||Ax - b||_2  subject to  ||x||_1 <= tau``,
        
        The matrix ``A`` can be defined explicitly, or as an operator
        that returns both both ``Ax`` and ``A'b``.
        
        SPGL1 can solve these three problems in both the real and complex domains.
