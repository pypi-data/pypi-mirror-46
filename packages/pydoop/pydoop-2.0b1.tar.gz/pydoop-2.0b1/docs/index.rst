   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

**Pydoop** is a Python interface to `Hadoop
<http://hadoop.apache.org>`_ that allows you to write MapReduce
applications in pure Python:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/pydoop_submit/mr/wordcount_minimal.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: Mapper

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/pydoop_submit/mr/wordcount_minimal.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: Reducer

Feature highlights:

* a rich :ref:`HDFS API <hdfs_api_tutorial>`;

* a :ref:`MapReduce API <api_tutorial>` that allows to write pure
  Python record readers / writers, partitioners and combiners;

* transparent :ref:`Avro (de)serialization <avro_io>`.

Pydoop enables MapReduce programming via a pure (except for a
performance-critical serialization section) Python client for Hadoop
Pipes, and HDFS access through an extension module based on `libhdfs
<https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.6.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/LibHdfs.html>`_.

To get started, read the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`.  Full docs,
including :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`, are listed
