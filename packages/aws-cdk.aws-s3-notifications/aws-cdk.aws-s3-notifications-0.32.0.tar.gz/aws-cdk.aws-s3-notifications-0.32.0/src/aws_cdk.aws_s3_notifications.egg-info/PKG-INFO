Description: ## S3 Bucket Notifications API
        
        This module includes the API that constructs should implement in order to be
        able to be used as destinations for bucket notifications.
        
        To implement the `IBucketNotificationDestination`, a construct should implement
        a method `asBucketNotificationDestination(bucketArn, bucketId)` which registers
        this resource as a destination for bucket notifications _for the specified
        bucket_ and returns the ARN of the destination and it's type.
