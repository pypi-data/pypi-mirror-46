        HistomicsTK is a Python and REST API for the analysis of Histopathology images
        in association with clinical and genomic data.
        
        Histopathology, which involves the examination of thin-slices of diseased
        tissue at a cellular resolution using a microscope, is regarded as the gold
        standard in clinical diagnosis, staging, and prognosis of several diseases
        including most types of cancer. The recent emergence and increased clinical
        adoption of whole-slide imaging systems that capture large digital images of
        an entire tissue section at a high magnification, has resulted in an explosion
        of data. Compared to the related areas of radiology and genomics, there is a
        dearth of mature open-source tools for the management, visualization and
        quantitative analysis of the massive and rapidly growing collections of
        data in the domain of digital pathology. This is precisely the gap that
        we aim to fill with the development of HistomicsTK.
        
        Developed in coordination with the `Digital Slide Archive`_ and
        `large_image`_, HistomicsTK aims to serve the needs of both
        pathologists/biologists interested in using state-of-the-art algorithms
        to analyze their data, and algorithm researchers interested in developing
        new/improved algorithms and disseminate them for wider use by the community.
        
        HistomicsTK can be used in two ways:
        
        - **As a pure Python package**: This is intended to enable algorithm
          researchers to use and/or extend the analytics functionality within
          HistomicsTK in Python. HistomicsTK provides algorithms for fundamental
          image analysis tasks such as color normalization, color deconvolution,
          cell-nuclei segmentation, and feature extraction. Please see the
          `api-docs <https://digitalslidearchive.github.io/HistomicsTK/api-docs.html>`__
          and `examples <https://digitalslidearchive.github.io/HistomicsTK/examples.html>`__
          for more information.
        
          This can be installed via `pip install histomicstk`. 
        
          If you want to specify precise library versions for reading various
          microscopy formats, you will need to install various libraries via your
          package manager or from source (libopenslide-dev, libtiff-dev).
        
          To avoid installing these complex dependencies, you can install
          using specific prebuilt wheels via 
          `pip install histomicstk -f https://manthey.github.io/large_image_wheels`.
        
        - **As a server-side Girder plugin for web-based analysis**: This is intended
          to allow pathologists/biologists to apply analysis modules/pipelines
          containerized in HistomicsTK's docker plugins on data over the web. Girder_
          is a Python-based framework (under active development by Kitware_) for
          building web-applications that store, aggregate, and process scientific data.
          It is built on CherryPy_ and provides functionality for authentication,
          access control, customizable metadata association, easy upload/download of
          data, an abstraction layer that exposes data stored on multiple backends
          (e.g. Native file system, Amazon S3, MongoDB GridFS) through a uniform
          RESTful API, and most importantly an extensible plugin framework for
          building server-side analytics apps. To inherit all these capabilities,
          HistomicsTK is being developed to act also as a Girder plugin in addition
          to its use as a pure Python package. To further support web-based analysis,
          HistomicsTK depends on three other Girder plugins: (i) girder_worker_ for
          distributed task execution and monitoring, (ii) large_image_ for displaying,
          serving, and reading large multi-resolution images produced by whole-slide
          imaging systems, and (iii) slicer_cli_web_ to provide web-based RESTFul
          access to image analysis pipelines developed as `slicer execution model`_
          CLIs and containerized using Docker.
