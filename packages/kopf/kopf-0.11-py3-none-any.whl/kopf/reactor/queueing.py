"""
Kubernetes watching/streaming and the per-object queueing system.

The framework can handle multiple resources at once.
Every custom resource type is "watched" (as in ``kubectl get --watch``)
in a separate asyncio task in the never-ending loop.

The events for this resource type (of all its objects) are then pushed
to the per-object queues, which are created and destroyed dynamically.
The per-object queues are created on demand.

Every object is identified by its uid, and is handled sequentially:
i.e. the low-level events are processed in the order of their arrival.
Other objects are handled in parallel in their own sequential tasks.

To prevent the memory leaks over the long run, the queues and the workers
of each object are destroyed if no new events arrive for some time.
The destruction delay (usually few seconds, maybe minutes) is needed
to prevent the often queue/worker destruction and re-creation
in case the events are for any reason delayed by Kubernetes.

The conversion of the low-level watch-events to the high-level causes
is done in the `kopf.reactor.handling` routines.
