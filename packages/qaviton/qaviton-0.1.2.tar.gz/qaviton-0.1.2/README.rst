Qaviton
=======

The first open source project to facilitate a unified testing automation framework for Web, Mobile & IoT
with Machine Learning, AI and much more: https://www.qaviton.com

Inspired by Appium & Selenium, Qaviton is a play on words for Graviton.
In theories of quantum gravity, the graviton
is the hypothetical elementary particle that mediates the force of gravity.
Qaviton is like the Graviton in the sense that if it exists,
it will be the solution to a fundamental problem in its field.

Qaviton offers an easy framework to automate tests that can run against any driver or any testing scenario,
and is meant to be like the React Native of software testing.


Installing
----------

make sure you have python 3.7+ installed.

we recommend using venv:

.. code-block:: text

to exit your virtual environment:

.. code-block:: text

    (venv) path/to/tests>deactivate


Simple Examples
---------------

.. code-block:: python

    python -m qaviton create web tests

.. code-block:: python

    python -m qaviton create web,mobile tests

.. code-block:: python

    python -m qaviton create web tests --example
    python -m pytest tests

.. code-block:: text

    $ python -m qaviton create tests
     * creating qaviton tests
     * your testing framework is done!
     * start testing like a boss âš›
