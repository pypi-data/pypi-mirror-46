# Ghost2md

A simple utility for converting the articles stored in a ghost backup file to Markdown. `ghost2md` will convert posts and pages to markdown files and will include any tags associated with the post as well.

## Motivation

I needed a simple tool for converting all my Ghost articles to markdown files which would be used by `Gatsby.js`. Didn't find any tools that produced markdown to my liking. Thus, `ghost2md` was born.

## Requirements

* Python 3.4+

## Installation

### Via pip
`pip3 install ghost2md --user`

### Via Poetry
`poetry install` (Run command inside of `ghost2md`)
