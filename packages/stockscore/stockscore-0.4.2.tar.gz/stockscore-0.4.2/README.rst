Stock Score is a python script to score stocks based on specified
criteria. The goal of this project is to provide a stock screening
system for various types of stock classifications (growth, momentum, value, etc.).

Similar to how one might rank the best options when they are deciding
where to go to dinner, Stock Score lets investors choose what screens
they want to run. Then, this script takes care of the rest,
showing which stocks performed best under the given screens.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can get the latest version of Python 3 here_ (this should come with the latest version of pip)
- All dependencies are contained in `requirements.txt` (more on that directly below)

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To clone this repository, run the following:
::

    git clone https://github.com/jackmoody11/stockscore


Change working directory to project folder
::

    cd my/path/to/stockscore

Create a virtual environment
::

    python3 -m venv env


Activate the virtual environment. See the docs_ for help.

Then :code:`make init` to install required modules.

Run the program!
----------------
To make sure that everything is working, while in the working directory of the stockScore project, run :code:`python3 stockscore.py`.

*Note*: Make sure you are using :code:`python3`.
This project does not support versions below Python 3.6 since it uses f strings.
This may change in the future to allow for earlier versions of Python to run.

Here is an example output of what you can expect to see when you run the program:

Terminal output:

Top 10 stocks output:

Running the tests
-----------------

All tests can be run by simply running
::

    pytest

In order to run a specific test file (like test_fundamental_functions.py), run
::

    pytest tests/test_fundamental_functions.py


To run a specific test (like "test_dividend_test_returns_scores" in test_fundamental_screens.py), run
::

    pytest tests/test_fundamental_screens.py -k 'test_dividend_test_returns_scores'


For more information on how to use pytest (like how to select a few tests),
`look here`_ for the official pytest docs.

Deployment
----------

In order to make code styling simple, this project uses black_. To make sure that this code adheres to this opinion based formatting, stockscore uses :code:`pre-commit`. In order to run black automatically before making a commit, please download :code:`pre-commit`.

You may need to run :code:`pre-commit install` before you are able to use this. For more details, check out the `pre-commit`_ website.

This project is very simple to deploy to a live system. To change which tests you are using, change which functions are added to the suites (this is the name used in both files) of :code:`fundamental_functions.py` and :code:`technical_functions.py`.

Built With
----------

Python 3 and some great third party modules (see `requirements.txt`_ for full list).
