  name: "KAPA RNA-Seq pipeline: BBDuk - STAR - featureCounts"
  version: 0.0.4
  description: |
    This RNA-seq pipeline is comprised of three steps: preprocessing, alignment, and
    quantification. First, reads are preprocessed by BBDuk which removes adapters, trims
    reads for quality from the 3'-end, and discards reads that are too short after trimming.
    Compared to similar tools, BBDuk is regarded for its computational efficiency. Next,
    preprocessed reads are aligned by STAR aligner. At the time of implementation, STAR is
    considered a state-of-the-art tool that consistently produces accurate results from diverse sets
    of reads, and performs well even with default settings. For more information see [this
    comparison of RNA-seq aligners](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4106). Finally, aligned
    reads are summarized to genes by featureCounts. Gaining wide adoption among the
    bioinformatics community, featureCounts yields expressions in a computationally efficient
    manner. All three tools in this workflow support parallelization to accelerate the analysis.
