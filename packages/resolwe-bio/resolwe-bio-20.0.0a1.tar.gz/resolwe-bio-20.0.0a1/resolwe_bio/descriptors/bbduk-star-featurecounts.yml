  name: "Pipeline: BBDuk - STAR - featureCounts"
  version: 0.1.3
  description: |
    "This RNA-seq pipeline is comprised of three steps: preprocessing, alignment, and
    quantification.\n\nFirst, reads are preprocessed by __BBDuk__ which removes adapters, trims
    reads for quality from the 3'-end, and discards reads that are too short after trimming.
    Compared to similar tools, BBDuk is regarded for its computational efficiency.\n\nNext,
    preprocessed reads are aligned by __STAR__ aligner. At the time of implementation, STAR is
    considered a state-of-the-art tool that consistently produces accurate results from diverse sets
    of reads, and performs well even with default settings. For more information see [this
    comparison of RNA-seq aligners](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4106).\n\nFinally, aligned
    reads are summarized to genes by __featureCounts__. Gaining wide adoption among the
    bioinformatics community, featureCounts yields expressions in a computationally efficient
    manner.\n\nAll three tools in this workflow support parallelization to accelerate the analysis."

      description: |
        In strand non-specific assay a read is considered overlapping with a
        feature regardless of whether it is mapped to the same or the opposite
        strand as the feature. In strand-specific forward assay and single
        reads, the read has to be mapped to the same strand as the feature.
        For paired-end reads, the first read has to be on the same strand and
        the second read on the opposite strand. In strand-specific reverse
        assay these rules are reversed.

        will be removed from the right end of reads.
