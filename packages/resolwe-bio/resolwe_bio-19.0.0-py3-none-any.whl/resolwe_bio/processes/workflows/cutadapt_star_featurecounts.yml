    This RNA-Seq pipeline is made to process single-end reads and consists of
    three steps, preprocessing, alignment and  quantification.

    First, reads are preprocessed by Cutadapt which by default drops reads
    that are shorter than 50 bp and reads having more than 2 'N' bases, then it
    removes bases from 3' end with quality below 20. Second, trimmed reads
    are aligned to genome by STAR aligner using two-pass mode. Finally,
    aligned reads are summarized to genes by featureCounts. Exons that
    overlap multiple genes are assigned to all of genes. Each overlapping gene
    receives a count of 1 / y, where y is the total number of genes overlapping
    with the read.

            In strand non-specific assay a read is considered overlapping with a feature regardless

            In strand-specific forward assay and single reads, the read has to be mapped to the
            same strand as the feature. For paired-end reads, the first read has to be on the same
            strand and the second read on the opposite strand. In strand-specific reverse
            assay these rules are reversed.
