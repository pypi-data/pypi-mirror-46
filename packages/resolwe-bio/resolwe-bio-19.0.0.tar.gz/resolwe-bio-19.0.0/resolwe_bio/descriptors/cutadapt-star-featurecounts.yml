  name: "Pipeline: Cutadapt - STAR (two pass mode) - featureCounts"
  version: 0.0.3
  description: |
    This RNA-Seq pipeline consists of three steps: preprocessing, alignment and  quantification.
    First, reads are preprocessed by Cutadapt which by default drops reads that are shorter
    than 50 bp and reads having more than 2 'N' bases, then it removes bases from 3' end with quality
    below 20. Second, trimmed reads are aligned to genome by STAR aligner using two-pass mode.
    Finally, aligned reads are summarized to genes by featureCounts. Exons that are overlapping
    to multiple genes are assigned to all of genes. Each overlapping gene receives a count of 1 / y,
    where y is the total number of genes overlapping with the read.

        Remove low quality bases from the 3' end. Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.

        Drop the read if it is below a specified length.

      type: basic:string
      default: non_specific
      choices:
        - label: Strand non-specific
          value: non_specific

          value: forward
        - label: Strand-specific reverse
          value: reverse
      description: |
        In strand non-specific assay a read is considered overlapping with a feature regardless
        of whether it is mapped to the same or the opposite strand as the feature.
        In strand-specific forward assay and single reads, the read has to be mapped to the
        same strand as the feature. For paired-end reads, the first read has to be on the same
        strand and the second read on the opposite strand. In strand-specific reverse
        assay these rules are reversed.

        Minimum fraction of overlapping bases in a read that is required for read assignment
      type: basic:decimal
      default: 0.0
      description: |
        Value should be within range [0, 1]. Number of overlapping bases is counted from both
        reads if paired end. Both this option and 'Minimum number of overlapping bases in a read
        that is required for read assignment' need to be satisfied for read assignment.

    - name: count_multi_mapping_reads

      type: basic:boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        For a multi-mapping read, all its reported alignments will be counted. The 'NH' tag in BAM
        input is used to detect multi-mapping reads.

    - name: fraction
      label: Assign fractional counts to features
      type: basic:boolean
      default: true
      description: |
        This option must be used together with 'Count multi-mapping reads' or 'Assign reads to
        all their overlapping features or meta-features' or both. When 'Count multi-mapping reads'
        is checked, each reported alignment from a multi-mapping read (identified via 'NH' tag)
        will carry a count of 1 / x, instead of 1 (one), where x is the total number of
        alignments reported for the same read. When 'Assign reads to all their overlapping
        features or meta-features' is checked, each overlapping feature will receive a count
        of 1 / y, where y is the total number of features overlapping with the read. When both
        'Count multi-mapping reads' and 'Assign reads to all their overlapping features or
        meta-features' are specified, each alignment will carry a count of 1 / (x * y).
