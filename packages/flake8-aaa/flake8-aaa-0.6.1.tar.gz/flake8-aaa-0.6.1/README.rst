Flake8-AAA
==========

A linter for Python tests.

* Pytest and unittest styles supported.

* Tests are linted against the `Arrange Act Assert pattern
  <http://jamescooke.info/arrange-act-assert-pattern-for-python-developers.html>`_.

  TL;DR following the AAA pattern means tests look like this::

      def test():
          """
          __docstring__
          """
          # ARRANGE: set up of the system under test (SUT)

          # ACT: perform a single action on the SUT

          # ASSERT: check that the SUT changed as expected

* Provides a Flake8 interface to automatically lint test files as part of your
  Flake8 run.

* Provides a command line interface for custom (non-Flake8) usage and
  debugging.

Installation
------------

Install with ``pip``::

    $ pip install flake8-aaa

Integration with Flake8
-----------------------

Given that you already have Flake8 installed in the same environment, check
that Flake8-AAA was installed correctly by asking ``flake8`` for its version
signature::

    $ flake8 --version
    3.7.7 (aaa: 0.6.0, mccabe: 0.6.1, pycodestyle: 2.5.0, pyflakes: 2.1.1) CPython 3.6.7 on Linux

The ``aaa: 0.6.0`` part of that output tells you ``flake8`` found this
plugin. Now you can run ``flake8`` as usual against your project and Flake8-AAA
will lint your tests via its plugin::

    $ flake8
