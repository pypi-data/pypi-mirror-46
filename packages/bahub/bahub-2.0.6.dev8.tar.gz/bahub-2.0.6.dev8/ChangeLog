CHANGES
=======

* Not raising an exception in the notifier, just printing it into the stdout - notification error cannot cancel a backup from creation
* Added APP\_DOMAIN variable in case when "Host" header could be incorrect because of eg. complex and invalid networking configuration
* Fixed developer toolbar displaying
* Minimum.ui: Polish/Polski translation
* Minimum.ui: Added tags, visibility, password fields
* Simplification

v2.0.5
------

* Covered ViewFileHandler partially
* Exported values marked as todo in the container to the .env variables
* Preparation for unit testing
* Fixed magic properties, we use only explicit properties
* Improving performance of the IoC container by excluding non-service classes
* Excluded Controllers and Migrations from coverage
* Added mockery for testing complex classes like Handlers
* Covered aggregate with tests
* Fixed HTTP Bytes range support. So now the application serves partial content on-demand when streaming media files, eg. video files
* The \`make run\_dev\` now runs an official docker image rather than the Symfony's built-in webserver. The reason was that the Symfony's built-in webserver does not support range requests and streaming so good as the NGINX does

* Added waiting for host to be up (eg. database) on server start
* Adjusted unit tests to changes on purpose
* Added definition name to the notifications and error messages
