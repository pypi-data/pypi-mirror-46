Description: placeload
        ---------
        
        A script to create a set of resource providers with simple inventory
        and membership in some aggregates in `placement service`_, so that
        subsequent requests can be made (with ``curl`` or whatever works)
        to test the service.
        
        Uses asyncio to create them quickly.
        
        Call it like::
        
            placeload <placement service url> [count] [semaphore_count]
        
        * **count** is the number of resource providers to create
        * **semaphore_count** is the number of concurrent
        
        It can be used with a `placedock`_ `container`_ if you need a quick
        way to start a placement.
