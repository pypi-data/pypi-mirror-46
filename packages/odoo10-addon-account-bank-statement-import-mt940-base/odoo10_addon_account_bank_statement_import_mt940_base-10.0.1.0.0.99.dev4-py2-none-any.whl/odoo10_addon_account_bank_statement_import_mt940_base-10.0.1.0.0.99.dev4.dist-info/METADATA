====================
Bank Statement MT940
====================

This module provides a generic parser for MT940 files. Given that MT940 is a
non-open non-standard of pure evil in the way that every bank cooks up its own
interpretation of it, this addon alone won't help you much. It is rather
intended to be used by other addons to implement the dialect specific to a
certain bank.

See account_bank_statement_import_mt940_nl_ing for an example on how to use it.
