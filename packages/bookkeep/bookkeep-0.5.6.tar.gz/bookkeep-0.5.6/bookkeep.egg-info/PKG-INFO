        What is bookkeep?
        -----------------
        
        bookkeep is a python package for keeping track of units of measure and measurment bounds. The package mainly features the SmartBook, a dictionary subclass that incorporates `pint Quantity objects  <https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ for managing units of measure.

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        bookkeep's documentation is available on the web:
        
            http://bookkeep.readthedocs.io/
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        **SmartBook objects are dictionaries that provide an easy way to keep track of units of measure and enforce bounds.**
            
        Create a `SmartBook <https://bookkeep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SmartBook.html>`__ object with *units*, *bounds*, a *source* description, and arguments to initialize the dictionary:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> sb = SmartBook(units={'T': 'K', 'Duty': 'kJ/hr'},
            ...                bounds={'T': (0, 1000)},
            ...                source='Operating conditions',
            ...                T=350)
            >>> sb
            {'T': 350 (K)}
        
        The *units* attribute becomes a `UnitManager <https://bookkeep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UnitManager.html>`__ object with a reference to all dictionaries (*clients*) it controls. These include the SmartBook and its bounds.
        
        .. code-block:: python    
            
            >>> sb.units
            UnitManager:
            {'T': 'degC',
             'Duty': 'kJ/hr'}
            >>> sb.units.clients
            [{'T': 350 (K)}, {'T': (0, 1000)}]
        
        Change units:
        
        .. code-block:: python
            
            >>> sb.units['T'] = 'degC'
            >>> sb
            {'T': 76.85 (degC)}
            >>> sb.bounds
            {'T': array([ -273.15, 726.85])}
        
        Add items:
        
        .. code-block:: python    
                
            >>> sb['P'] = 101325
            >>> sb
            {'T': 76.85 (degC),
             'P': 101325}
            
        Add units:
        
        .. code-block:: python    
                
            >>> sb.units['P'] = 'Pa'
            >>> sb
            {'T': 76.85 (degC),
             'P': 101325 (Pa)}
             
        A BookkeepWarning is issued when a value is set out of bounds:
        
        .. code-block:: python
                        
            >>> sb['T'] = -300
            __main__:1: BookkeepWarning: @Operating conditions: T (-300 degC) is out of bounds (-273.15 to 726.85 degC).
        
        **Nested SmartBook objects are easy to read, and can be made using the same units and bounds.**
        
        Create new SmartBook objects:
        
        .. code-block:: python    
            
            >>> sb1 = SmartBook(sb.units, sb.bounds,
            ...                 T=25, P=500)
            >>> sb2 = SmartBook(sb.units, sb.bounds,
            ...                 T=50, Duty=50)
            >>> sb1
            {'T': 25 (degC),
             'P': 500 (Pa)}
            >>> sb2
            {'T': 50 (degC),
             'Duty': 50 (kJ/hr)})
            
        Create nested SmartBook:
            
        .. code-block:: python    
            
            >>> nsb = SmartBook(sb1=sb1, sb2=sb2)
            {'sb1':
                {'T': 25 (degC),
                 'P': 500 (Pa)},
             'sb2':
                {'T': 50 (degC),
                 'Duty': 50 (kg/hr)}}
            
        **Pint** `Quantity <https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ **objects are also compatible, so long as the corresponding Quantity class is set as the Quantity attribute.**
        
        Set a Quantity object:
            
        .. code-block:: python
             
            >>> Q_ = SmartBook.Quantity
            >>> sb1.bounds['T'] = Q_((0, 1000), 'K')
            >>> sb1['T'] = Q_(100, 'K')
            >>> sb1
            {'T': -173.15 degC,
             'P': 500 (Pa)}
        
        Setting a Quantity object out of bounds will issue a warning:
        
        .. code-block:: python 
            
            >>> sb1['T'] = Q_(-1, 'K')
             __main__:1: BookkeepWarning: T (-274.15 degC) is out of bounds (-273.15 to 726.85 degC).
        
        Trying to set a Quantity object with wrong dimensions will raise an error:
        
        .. code-block:: python
            
            >>> Q_ = SmartBook.Quantity    
            >>> sb1['T'] = Q_(100, 'meter')
            DimensionalityError: Cannot convert from 'meter' ([length]) to 'degC' ([temperature])
