*Starfish* is a set of tools used for spectroscopic inference. We designed the package to robustly determine stellar parameters using high resolution spectral models.

Please bear in mind that this package is under heavy development and features may evolve rapidly. If something doesn't work, please fill an [issue](https://github.com/iancze/Starfish/issues) on this repository. If you would like to contribute to this project (either with bugfixes, documentation, or new features) please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request!

# Installation Instructions

## Prerequisites

*Starfish* has several dependencies, however most of them should be satisfied by an up-to-date scientific python installation. We highly recommend using the [Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) and updating to 
Python 3.6 or greater. This code makes no attempt to work on the Python 2.x series, and I doubt it will if you try. This package is tested across Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. 

To make sure you are running the correct version of python, start a python interpreter via the system shell and you should see something similar

    $ python
    Python 3.6.1 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, May 11 2017, 13:25:24) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

If your shell says Python 2.x, try using the `python3` command instead of `python`.

## Installation

For the most current release of *Starfish*, use the releases from PyPI

    $ pip install astrostarfish

If you want to be on the most up-to-date version (or a development version), install from source via

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/iancze/Starfish.git#egg=astrostarfish


To test that you've properly installed *Starfish*, try doing the following inside of a Python interpreter session

```python
>>> import Starfish
>>> Starfish.__version__
'0.3.0'
```

If you see any errors, then something went wrong--please file an [issue](https://github.com/iancze/Starfish/issues).

Now that you've successfully installed the code, please see the [documentation](https://starfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on how to begin using *Starfish* to solve your spectroscopic inference problem.

# Contributing
If you are interested in contributing to *Starfish*, first off, thank you! We appreciate your time and effort into
making our project better. To get set up in a development environment, it is highly recommended to develop in a
virtual environment. We use `pipenv` to manage our environments, to get started clone the repository (and we recommend forking us first)

    $ git clone https://github.com/<your_fork>/Starfish.git starfish
    $ cd starfish

and then create the virtual environment and install pacakges from the `Pipfile` with

    $ pipenv install -d

and to enter the virtual environment, simply issue

    $ pipenv shell

whenever you're in the `starfish` folder.

Take a look through the [issues](https://github.com/iancze/Starfish/issues) if you are looking for a place to start improving *Starfish*!

**Tests**

We use `py.test` for testing; within the virtual environment

    $ pytest
