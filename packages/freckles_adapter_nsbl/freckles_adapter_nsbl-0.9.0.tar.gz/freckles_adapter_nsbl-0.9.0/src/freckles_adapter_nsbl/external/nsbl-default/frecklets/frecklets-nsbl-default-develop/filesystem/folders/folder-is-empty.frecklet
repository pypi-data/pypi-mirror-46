  help: |
    Ensure a folder exists on the filesystem and is empty.

    If a file or folder already exists for that path, it will be deleted before the new folder will be created.

    If the ``owner`` and/or ``group`` variables is/are specified, create those in case they don't exist yet.

    If the ``owner`` variable is specified, this frecklet will use elevated permissions.
  examples:
    - title: Create a folder if it doesn't exist yet.
      vars:
        path: /tmp/freckles
    - title: Create a folder incl. parent folders if necessary.

        path: /tmp/parent_1/parent_2/freckles
