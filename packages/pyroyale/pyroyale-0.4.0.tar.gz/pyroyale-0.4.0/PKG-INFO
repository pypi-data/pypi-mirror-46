Description: ==================================================
        pyroyale -- Clash Royale API wrapper
        ==================================================
        
        This is a tool for data from the official ClashRoyale developer API. See
        https://developer.clashroyale.com to sign up for a developer account and
        create an API key to use with this.
        
        ==================================================
        Work in Progress
        ==================================================
        
        You probably shouldn't use this yet. It's very much a work in progress.
        It's also an incomplete implementation at this time. I've only
        implemented the few API endpoints required for
        `crtools <https://github.com/AaronTraas/Clash-Royale-Clan-Tools>`_,
        which are:
        
        - /v1/clans/{clan_tag}
        - /v1/clans/{clan_tag}/warlog
        - /v1/clans/{clan_tag}/currentwar
        
        I plan on implementing the entire API eventually, but it's not present at this
        time.
        
        ==================================================
        Integration tests
        ==================================================
        
        If you wish to work on this project, and run integration tests whenever you
        run `make test` or `python3 setup.py test`, you need to create a file called
        `.crtools` in your home folder (must resolve as `~/.crtools`), and it must
        contain the following:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
          [API]
          api_key=<YOUR-API-KEY>
        
        The API key can be acquired at https://developer.clashroyale.com
        
        Note that the key is limited to a specific list of public IP addresses. This
        is why integration tests aren't done on Travis -- we need a static IP.
        
        ==================================================
        Development links
        ==================================================
        
        This project uses SonarQube for static analysis. The results of analysis
        are at `SonarCloud <https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=AaronTraas_pyroyale>`_.
        The code quality and test coverage are a work in progress.
