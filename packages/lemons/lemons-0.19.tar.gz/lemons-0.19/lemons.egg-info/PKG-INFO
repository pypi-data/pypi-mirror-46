Description: # Lemons
        
        A package that makes things easy.
        
        ## Why lemons?
        
        Originally intending to call this package *ezpz*, it was soon discovered that the name had already been taken. Heartbroken, and with no other ideas for what to call this package, it felt like the world had ended. The feeling of dread and loss was devastating - debilitating, even.
        
        Nonetheless, when life give you lemons, you squeeze them! Aha, an epiphany: why not go back to the root of it all, the title of one of my earliest programs: *EZPZ Lemon Squeezy*? A simple yet elegant title was there all along, yearning to represent this package and all it stood for; the darkness vanished as quickly as it came, and the name *lemons* was born.
        
        ## What does it do?
        
        *Lemons* tries to make data crunching and GUI building easier by eliminating a lot of repetitive and error-prone code. Please keep in mind that the package is still in its infancy, so its functionality is currently quite limited.
        
        ### Data Crunching
        
        With one line of code each, *lemons* can currently:
        
        * Read a .csv file and return the desired columns
        * Write data to a .csv file
        * Separate a data set into header data and body data
        * Combine the header data with the body data again if necessary
        
        ### GUI Building
        
        The tkinter framework, as many know, is not the most user-friendly GUI-builder out there. *Lemons* hopes to help ease that pain a little. This is where this package really shines.
        
        Some of the things that can be done:
        
        * Easily create a horizontal separator with vertical padding
        * Add convenient spacing between widgets
        * Make input and output fields and lists, and then easily get the filepaths of the selections
        * Creating a scrollable notebook tab, which previously took dozens of lines of code per tab, can now be done in just two:
        
                tab = lemons.gui.ScrollableTab(notebook, 'Title')
                # Your tab contents here
                tab.update()
        
        ## Special Thanks
