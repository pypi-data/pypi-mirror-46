Description: # **wexpect**
        
        *Wexpect* is a Windows variant of [pexpect](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
        
        *Pexpect* is a Python module for spawning child applications and controlling
        them automatically.
        
        **!! UPDATE !!**
        
        I'm glad to announce that python-3 is supported form version 2.3.3
        
        ## **Install**
        
            pip install wexpect
            
        ## **Usage**
        
        To interract with a child process use `spawn` method:
        
        ```python
        import wexpect 
        child = wexpect.spawn('cmd.exe')
        child.expect('>')
        child.sendline('ls')
        child.expect('>')
        print(child.before)
        ```
        
        For more information see [examples](./examples) folder.

        ## What is it?
        
        Wexpect is a Python module for spawning child applications and controlling
        them automatically. Wexpect can be used for automating interactive applications
        such as ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setup
        scripts for duplicating software package installations on different servers. It
        can be used for automated software testing. Wexpect is in the spirit of Don
        Libes' Expect, but Wexpect is pure Python. Other Expect-like modules for Python
        require TCL and Expect or require C extensions to be compiled. Wexpect does not
        use C, Expect, or TCL extensions. 
        
        Original Pexpect should work on any platform that supports the standard Python pty module. While
        Wexpect works on Windows platforms. The Wexpect interface focuses on ease of use so that simple
        tasks are easy.
        
        
        ### History
        
        Wexpect is a one-file code developed at University of Washington. There are several
        [copy](https://gist.github.com/anthonyeden/8488763) and
        [reference](https://mediarealm.com.au/articles/python-pexpect-windows-wexpect/)
        to this code with very few (almost none) documentation nor integration.
        
        This repo tries to fix these limitations, with a few example code and pypi integration.

        ## Installation of wexpect
        
        ### Standard installation
        
        This version is uploaded to pypi server so you can easily install with pip:
        
            pip install wexpect
            
        ### Manual installation
        
        Because this is a tiny project dropping the wexpect.py file into your working directory is usually
        good enough instead of installing. However in this case you need to install manually the one dependence.
        
        One (non stanbdard) package, **pypiwin32** is needed by wexpect.
        
            pip install pypiwin32

        Thanks for any contributing!
        
        To run test, enter into the folder of the wexpect's repo then:
        
        `python -m pytest tests`
