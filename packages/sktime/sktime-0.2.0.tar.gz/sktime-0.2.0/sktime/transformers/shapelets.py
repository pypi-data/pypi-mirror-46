# TO-DO: thorough testing (some initial testing completed, but passing the code to David to develop
#        before everything has been fully verified)
# TO-DO: check the validity of the binary info gain method and implement the early abandon as
#        in original shapelet paper (not possible for non-binary IG however)
# TO-DO: revisit contract timing - currently it's lazy (will process the last shapelet and go over the limit)
#        A more sensible approach would be to estimate the average/median/max shapelet calculation time and
#        only process a new candidate if there is enough time left. Max would be safest but most conservative
#        estimate, mean is easiest to calculate without storing/sorting run-times. Investigation req.
# TO-DO: Random and ContractedRandom transforms use all of the same logic but have different class types for
#        distinctions (Contracted extends Random with flags to set). However, Tony would now prefer to have a
#        single class with a flag for contract or not, so code should be refactored into a single class
# TO-DO: Transform currently only for univariate data - once all of the above is reconciled we should extend
#        to the multi-variate case (should be fairly simple - done in Java, though not sure on the specifics/how
#        complete it is and if we could use mutivariate data in other ways too
# TO-DO: Currently extends TransformerMixin - class should extend the sktime transformer base class (not on dev at
#        branch at time of writing however so this can be updated later)
# TO-DO: Add a parameter to cap the number of shapelets to use in the final transform. Not done yet as we should
#        look at the Java implementation to see what the default was. If there isn't one, we could use an
#        arbitrary value such as 200 as a default? The limit would be after all shapelets are extracted and sorted
#        in descending order of information gain (e.g. keep the top 200 shapelets, not the first 200 that
#        were visited)
# TO-DO: verbose output of time remaining for contract is currently in decimal format, e.g.:
#        > Candidate finished. 0.418 minutes remaining.
#        it would be nicer (but not that important) to convert this to mins:secs rather than a decimal for minutes
#        e.g. 5:45 left, rather than 5.75


class RandomShapeletTransform(BaseTransformer):
    """Random Shapelet Transform.

    A transformer to extract shapelets from a training dataset, then transform any
    passed dataset into primitives using each extracted shapelet. For k shapelets,
    an input case q is transformed by calculating the distance from q to each shapelet
    and the transformed output case is composed of k features, where the kth attribute
    is the distance from q to the kth shapelet.

    This implementation of the transform is based on the findings in [2]; it uses random
    sampling of candidate shapelets, rather than a full enumeration of candidates as
    originally proposed in [1], as it has been shown that there is no significant
    decrease in accuracy but a significant reduction in runtime through this approach.

    There are two versions of the transform: RandomShapeletTransform and
    ContractedRandomShapeletTransform. For each training series visited, both
    implementations assess a specified number of candidate shapelets per series. However,
    this version visits an explict number of cases to extract these shapelets from (from
    1 to len(X), whereas ContractedRandomShapeletTransform visits training cases while
    time remains on a contact (specified in minutes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_shapelet_length : int (default = 3)
        The minimum candidate shapelet length
    max_shapelet_length :int (default = np.inf)
        The maximum candidate shapelet length (default = np.inf). This value is
        an upper-bound and is automatically capped to the series length if the
        specified value exceeds the length of the shapelet.
    num_cases_to_sample: int (default = 5)
        The number of training cases to extract candidate shapelets from.
    num_shapelets_to_sample_per_case: int (default = 15)
        The number of shapelet candidates to evaluate per series in the fit method
    seed: int (default = 0)
        To seed the shapelet discovery to ensure deterministic results across multiple runs
    dim_to_use: int (default = 0)
        Which dimension of the data to use
    remove_self_similar: bool (default = True)
        Whether to remove self-similar shapelets before transforming. A candidate shapelet
        is considered to be self-similar to another candidate if they are taken from the
        same dimension of the same training series. With this set to True, any overlapping
        candidates will be removed to preserve the best candidate (i.e. highest info gain)
    verbose: bool (default = False)
        Whether to print information during shapelet extraction
    use_binary_info_gain: bool (default = True)
        Whether to use one-vs-all information gain (as in [2]) or consider each class
        independently when calculating the information gain of a candidate (as in [1])
    trim_shapelets: bool (default = True)
        Whether to crop the final list of extracted shapelets to the top k. If specified,
        this is an upper-bound; if less than k shapelets are found then this parameter will
        have no effect
    num_shapelets_to_trim_to: int (default = 200)
        If trim_shapelets = True, this is the number of shapelets to trim to.

    Attributes
    ----------
    shapelets: list of Shapelet objects
        The list of extracted shapelets after fit is called (initially shapelets = None)

class ContractedRandomShapeletTransform(RandomShapeletTransform):
    """
    Contracted Random Shapelet Transform (extends Random Shapelet Transform).

    A transformer to extract shapelets from a training dataset, then transform any
    passed dataset into primitives using each extracted shapelet. For k shapelets,
    an input case q is transformed by calculating the distance from q to each shapelet
    and the transformed output case is composed of k features, where the kth attribute
    is the distance from q to the kth shapelet.

    This implementation of the transform is based on the findings in [2]; it uses random
    sampling of candidate shapelets, rather than a full enumeration of candidates as
    originally proposed in [1], as it has been shown that there is no significant
    decrease in accuracy but a significant reduction in runtime through this approach.

    There are two versions of the transform: RandomShapeletTransform and
    ContractedRandomShapeletTransform. For each training series visited, both
    implementations assess a specified number of candidate shapelets per series. However,
    this version uses a contracted time limit; it visits a series, extracts an explict
    number of shapelets, and then moves onto the next series. This continues until the
    time limit is breached, and if the end of the data is reached first, the algorithm
    will loop back round to the first series and extract the specified number of shapelets
    again. The time limit is specified in minutes and is a lower-bound; if a shapelet is
    being evaluated when the time limit is reached, it will complete before the extraction
    process exits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_shapelet_length : int (default = 3)
        The minimum candidate shapelet length
    max_shapelet_length :int (default = np.inf)
        The maximum candidate shapelet length (default = np.inf). This value is
        an upper-bound and is automatically capped to the series length if the
        specified value exceeds the length of the shapelet.
    time_limit_in_mins: float (default = 60.0)
        The contract time limit to continue shapelet extraction. This is a lower-bound as a
        shapelet candidate will not be abandoned if the time limit runs out.
    initial_num_shapelets_per_case: int (default = 15)
        The number of shapelet candidates to evaluate per series in the fit method initially.
        If there is sufficient time remaining on the contract after this number of shapelets
        have been evaluated from all training series, the search will continue at the start
        of the data and extract this many shapelets from each series again.
    seed: int (default = 0)
        To seed the shapelet discovery to ensure deterministic results across multiple runs
    dim_to_use: int (default = 0)
        Which dimension of the data to use
    remove_self_similar: bool (default = True)
        Whether to remove self-similar shapelets before transforming. A candidate shapelet
        is considered to be self-similar to another candidate if they are taken from the
        same dimension of the same training series. With this set to True, any overlapping
        candidates will be removed to preserve the best candidate (i.e. highest info gain)
    verbose: bool (default = False)
        Whether to print information during shapelet extraction
    use_binary_info_gain: bool (default = True)
        Whether to use one-vs-all information gain (as in [2]) or consider each class
        independently when calculating the information gain of a candidate (as in [1])
    trim_shapelets: bool (default = True)
        Whether to crop the final list of extracted shapelets to the top k. If specified,
        this is an upper-bound; if less than k shapelets are found then this parameter will
        have no effect
    num_shapelets_to_trim_to: int (default = 200)
        If trim_shapelets = True, this is the number of shapelets to trim to.

    Attributes
    ----------
    shapelets: list of Shapelet objects
        The list of extracted shapelets after fit is called (initially shapelets = None)
