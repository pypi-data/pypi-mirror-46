Description: This package patches the web application server Zope to improve its
        cookie handling.
        
        Currently, it defines ``register_cookie_param(`` *name*, *type*  ``='string'``, *pname*  ``=None)``
        to define additional parameters recognized when cookies are generated.
        *name* is the parameter given to Zope's ``setCookie`` method, *pname*
        is the corresponding parameter name in the generated ``Set-Cookie`` response header.
        If not specified, *pname* is derived from *name* by replacing ``_`` by ``-``.
        *type* specifies this parameter's type. Currently defined values are
        ``'string'`` (normal string, quoted when it contains whitespace, comma or
        semicolon), ``'quoted-string'`` (a string unconditionally quoted),
        ``'boolean'`` (boolean parameter, only the name and no value is generated), ``sequence`` (generates a quoted comma separated sequence).
        
        **ATTENTION** `RFC 6265`__ has drastically simplified the ``Set-Cookie`` syntax
        (over the now obsolete `RFC 2965`__):
        it is no longer possible to quote ``;`` by
        including it in a doubly quoted string. This means that ``;`` can no
        longer be part of a cookie attribute value
        (unless `RFC 2047`__ encoded).

        Import of ``dm.zopepatches.cookies.httponly`` provides for ``httponly``
        support. It registers both ``httponly`` as well as ``http_only``.
        The former is the spelling consistent with other cookie parameters, the
        latter is the spelling used by Zope 2.12.
