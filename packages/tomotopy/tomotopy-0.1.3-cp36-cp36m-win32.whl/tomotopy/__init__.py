"""
Python package `tomotopy` provides types and functions for various Topic Model 
including LDA, DMR, HDP, MG-LDA, PA and HPA. It is written in C++ for speed and provides Python extension.

In human language technologies: The 2010 annual conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 465-473). Association for Computational Linguistics.
    
    There are three options for term weighting and the basic one is ONE. The others also can be applied for every topic model in `tomotopy`.
