Description: # rainbownum
        Program used to generate colorings and the anti-Schur numbers for a given equation.
        
        An anti-Schur number, denoted aS([n], k, [a], b), is defined as the smallest number of colors r such that every coloring of [n] if guaranteed to have a rainbow sum to the equations a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_kx_k = b.
