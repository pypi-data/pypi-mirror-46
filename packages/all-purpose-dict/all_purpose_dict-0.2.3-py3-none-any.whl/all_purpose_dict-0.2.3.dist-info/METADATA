### What is it?

- A dict which doesn't require hashable keys

<br>

### Why create it?

- I often have a need to store non-hashable keys in a dict.  For example storing
  a dict as a key isn't possible with the builtin dict.

  ```py
  # doesn't work
  someDict = { "key": "value" }
  anotherDict = { someDict: "anotherValue" }
  ```

<br>

### Simple usage

```py
from all_purpose_dict import ApDict

someDict = { "key": "value" }
anotherDict = ApDict([(someDict, "anotherValue")])

print(someDict in anotherDict) # prints True
```

<br>

<br>

### Api

*Note: This api is young and subject to change quite a bit.  There also may be
functionality present in the builtin dict which ApDict doesn't cover.  I'm
willing to add it so please just raise a github issue or PR with details.*

#### class ApDict([a list of pairs])
- 'pairs' may be either a list or tuple with a length of 2
- all methods return `self` unless specified otherwise
- iterates in the order of insertion
- views are not implemented because I don't have a need for them. Instead I
  expose `keysIterator` and `valuesIterator`.  If you need views then raise a
  github issue.
- the internal methods implemented are
  - \_\_contains\_\_
  - \_\_delitem\_\_
  - \_\_getitem\_\_
  - \_\_iter\_\_
  - \_\_len\_\_
  - \_\_setitem\_\_

##### clear()

##### delete(key)
- a function alternative to `del aDict[key]`

##### get(key, default=None) => value
- get the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default.
- *note: this never raises a KeyError.*

##### has(key) => bool
- a function alternative to `key in aDict`

##### getKeysIterator() => ApDictKeysIterator

##### set(key, value)
- a function alternative to `aDict[key] = val`

##### getValuesIterator() => ApDictValuesIterator

### Test

```sh
#
# you must have poetry installed
#
$ poetry shell
$ poetry install
$ python runTests.py
```
