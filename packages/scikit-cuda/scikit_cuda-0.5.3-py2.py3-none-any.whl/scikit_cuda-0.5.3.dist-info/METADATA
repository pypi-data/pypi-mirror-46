Package Description
-------------------
scikit-cuda provides Python interfaces to many of the functions in the CUDA
device/runtime, CUBLAS, CUFFT, and CUSOLVER libraries distributed as part of
NVIDIA's `CUDA Programming Toolkit <http://www.nvidia.com/cuda/>`_, as well as
interfaces to select functions in the `CULA Dense Toolkit <http://www.culatools.com/dense>`_.
Both low-level wrapper functions similar to their C counterparts and high-level
functions comparable to those in `NumPy and Scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ are provided.

Documentation
-------------
Package documentation is available at
`<http://scikit-cuda.readthedocs.org/>`_.  Many of the high-level
functions have examples in their docstrings. More illustrations of how
to use both the wrappers and high-level functions can be found in the
``demos/`` and ``tests/`` subdirectories.
