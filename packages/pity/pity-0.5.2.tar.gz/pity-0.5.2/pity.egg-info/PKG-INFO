        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peercoin/pity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peercoin/pity)
        
        Forked from Ofek's awesome [Bit library](https://github.com/ofek/bit).
        
        Pity is based on Bit, the [Python's fastest](https://ofek.github.io/bit/guide/intro.html#why-bit)
        Bitcoin library and was designed from the beginning to feel intuitive, be
        effortless to use, and have readable source code.
        
        **Pity is so easy to use, in fact, you can do this:**
        
        ```
            >>> from bit import Key
            >>>
            >>> my_key = Key(wif="...")
            >>> my_key.get_balance('eur')
            '12.51'
            >>> # Let's pity the fool! Umm,... Let's donate!
            >>> outputs = [
            >>>     # the Peercoin Foundation
            >>>     ('p92W3t7YkKfQEPDb7cG9jQ6iMh7cpKLvwK', 10, 'usd'),
            >>>     # Beer for willy, PeerExplorer <https://peercoinexplorer.net/charts/>
            >>>     ('PA3VZmupxdsX5TuS1PyXZPsbbhZGT2htPz', 3, 'eur')
            >>> ]
            >>>
            >>> my_key.send(outputs)
            '1da615c003bb1bd98354378fa5e95287993dab152d876fa0cc3980566ce6d7ee'
        ```
