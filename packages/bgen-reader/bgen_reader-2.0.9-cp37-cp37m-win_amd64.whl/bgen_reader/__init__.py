"""
BGEN file format reader
=======================

`BGEN <http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format/>`_ is a file format for storing large
genetic datasets. It supports both unphased genotypes and phased haplotype data with
variable ploidy and number of alleles. It was designed to provides a compact data
representation without sacrificing variant access performance.

Functions
---------
create_metadata_file  Create variants metadata file.
read_bgen             Read a given BGEN file.
test                  Verify this package's integrity.
