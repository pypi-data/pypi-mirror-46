features:
  - Till now, the ovs service file and ovs-ctl command files are patched
    to allow ovs to run with qemu group. In order to remove this
    workarounds, a new group hugetlbfs is created which will be shared
    between ovs and qemu. Use env file ovs-dpdk-permissions.yaml while
    deploying.
