# rxpy-backpressure
Back pressure strategies for use with RxPy

## Goals
This projects goal is to provide a simple api that allows the addition of backpressure strategies with RxPy. 

## Project Roadmap
- [X] Support Latest strategy
- [X] Develop a small application to show the use of the library
- [X] Support Drop strategy
- [ ] Support Buffer strategy
- [ ] Support Error Strategy

## Getting Started
To get started pull the code from pypi with a ```pip install rxpy_backpressure``` the project can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/rxpy-backpressure/)

### API Examples

Example of usage of the API with rxpy 1.6

```
from rxpy_backpressure import BackPressure

image_observable
    .observe_on(scheduler)
    .subscribe(BackPressure.LATEST(observer))
```

Example of usage of the API with rxpy ~3

```
from rxpy_backpressure import BackPressure

image_observable
    .subscribe(BackPressure.LATEST(observer), scheduler)

```

If you would like to quickly get started with the library a runnable
example can be found here [rxpy-backpressure-example](https://github.com/daliclass/rxpy-backpressure-example)

### Strategies

#### Latest
Latest strategy will remember the next most recent message to process 
and will call the observer with it when the observer has finished 
processing its current message.

#### Drop
Drop strategy accepts a cache_size, the strategy will remember the most 
recent messages and remove older messages from the cache. The strategy 
guarantees that the oldest messages in the cache are passed to the 
observer first.

## Considerations
This project supports python 3.6+ as as [rxpy](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY)
3.0.0+ is support this is not support ealier versions. If there is a 
case to support previous versions this will be considered however the 
typing introduced in python 3.6 is very nice to produce a self documenting API.
