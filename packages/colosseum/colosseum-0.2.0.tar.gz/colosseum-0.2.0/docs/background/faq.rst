So... why the name Colosseum?
=============================

The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheater, is an ancient Roman
Amphitheater in the center of Rome. It is an astonding piece of ancient
architecture, noted for it's three layers of arches, framed by Doric, Ionic
and Corinthian half-columns, with an attic decorate with Corinthian pilasters.

Much like Doric, Ionic and Corithian columns form the fundamental architecture
of the ancient Roman world, CSS is part of the fundamental architecture of
modern display computing. The regular repeating structure of the Colosseum's
arches and columns mirror the regular grid-based layout of many modern web and
print designs.

The Colosseum was also a massive undertaking for it's time. Undertaking to
reproduce the entire CSS specification, with all it's quirks and
eccentricities, is a similarly massive undertaking.

But most importantly: the name Colosseum contains, in order, the letters CSS.
