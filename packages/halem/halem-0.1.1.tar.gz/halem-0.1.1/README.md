Route optimization in dynamic flow fields
====================================

## Features
This package contains route optimization for given currents. The following features are taken into account in this version:
* Spatial varing currents
* Temporal changing currents
* Variable shipping velocity
* minimal water depth


Does not (yet) take into account:
* Squad
* Inertial behaviour of the ship

## Implementation
This package is build for implementation into the Open CL-Sim package (currently under development). 


## Installation
The Package can be installed using pip. Type following code in the python command prompt:

``` bash
pip install halem
```
