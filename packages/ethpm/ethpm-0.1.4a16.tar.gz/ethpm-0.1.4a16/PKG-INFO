        A Python implementation of the `Ethereum Package Manager
        Specification <http://ethpm.github.io/ethpm-spec/package-spec.html>`__.
        
        Read more in the documentation on
        `ReadTheDocs <https://py-ethpm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
        
        WARNING!
        
        ``Py-EthPM`` is currently in public alpha. *Keep in mind*: - It is
        expected to have bugs and is not meant to be used in production - Things
        may be ridiculously slow or not work at all
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           pip install ethpm
        
        Developer Setup
        ---------------
        
        If you would like to hack on Py-EthPM, please check out the `Ethereum
        Development Tactical
        Manual <https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-dev-tactical-manual>`__
        for information on how we do:

        Developer Environment Setup
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can set up your dev environment with:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           git clone git@github.com:ethpm/py-ethpm.git
           cd py-ethpm
           virtualenv -p python3 venv
           . venv/bin/activate
           pip install -e .[dev]
        
        Testing Setup
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        During development, you might like to have tests run on every file save.
        
        Show flake8 errors on file change:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           # Test flake8
           when-changed -v -s -r -1 py-ethpm/ tests/ -c "clear; flake8 py-ethpm tests && echo 'flake8 success' || echo 'error'"
        
        Run multi-process tests in one command, but without color:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           # in the project root:
           pytest --numprocesses=4 --looponfail --maxfail=1
           # the same thing, succinctly:
           pytest -n 4 -f --maxfail=1
        
        Run in one thread, with color and desktop notifications:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           cd venv
           ptw --onfail "notify-send -t 5000 'Test failure ⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠' 'python 3 test on <REPO_NAME> failed'" ../tests ../<MODULE_NAME>
        
        How to Execute the Tests?
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        1. `Setup your development
           environment <https://github.com/ethpm/py-ethpm/#developer-setup>`__.
        
        2. Execute ``tox`` for the tests
        
        There are multiple
        `components <https://github.com/ethpm/py-ethpm/blob/master/.circleci/.config.yml#L56>`__
        of the tests. You can run test to against specific component. For
        example:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           # Run Tests for the Core component (for Python 3.5):
           tox -e py35
        
           # Run Tests for the Core component (for Python 3.6):
           tox -e py36
        
        If for some reason it is not working, add ``--recreate`` params.
        
        ``tox`` is good for testing against the full set of build targets. But
        if you want to run the tests individually, ``py.test`` is better for
        development workflow. For example, to run only the tests in one file:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           pytest tests/ethpm/utils/test_uri_utils.py
        
        IPFS integration tests (``tests/ethpm/integration/``) require a direct
        connection to an IPFS node and are skipped by default (except in
        CircleCI, where they are run). To include these tests in your test run,
        first start an IPFS node and then add ``--integration`` to the pytest
        command.
        
        Release setup
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For Debian-like systems:
        
        ::
        
           apt install pandoc
        
        To release a new version:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           make release bump=$$VERSION_PART_TO_BUMP$$
        
        How to bumpversion
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The version format for this repo is ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}`` for
        stable, and ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{stage}.{devnum}`` for unstable
        (``stage`` can be alpha or beta).
        
        To issue the next version in line, specify which part to bump, like
        ``make release bump=minor`` or ``make release bump=devnum``.
        
        If you are in a beta version, ``make release bump=stage`` will switch to
        a stable.
        
        To issue an unstable version when the current version is stable, specify
        the new version explicitly, like
        ``make release bump="--new-version 4.0.0-alpha.1 devnum"``
