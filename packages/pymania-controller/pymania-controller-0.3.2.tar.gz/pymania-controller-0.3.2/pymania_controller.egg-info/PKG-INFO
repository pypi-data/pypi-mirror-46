Description: ## pymania
        A minimalistic server controller for the popular Trackmania racing games.
        
        ### Features
        - Centralized configuration for all plugins
        - Already contains plugins for out-of-the-box use
        - Ability to reload configuration and plugin code during execution
        - Asynchronous/parallel plugin loading (order and parallelism determined from inter-dependencies)
        - Dedicated server handler ID allocation does not create overlaps and is therefore suitable for high-load environments
        - Completely dynamic and fine-grained control over privileges
        - Scalable to a certain extent, despite dedicated server limitations
