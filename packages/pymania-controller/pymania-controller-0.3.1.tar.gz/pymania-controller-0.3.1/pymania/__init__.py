"""
A minimalistic server controller for the popular Trackmania racing games.

About scaling
-------------
Despite the limitations of the dedicated server, pymania is scalable under certain conditions:

    - Each instance should use different plugins, because TrackMania callbacks are distributed to
      all connected controllers. While this is not bad, it would have been nice to have a switch to
      use load balancing instead.
    - Certain plugins can be used in all instances ('scalable plugins'), such as remote.
        - All scalable plugins should have a description that they are indeed scalable.
        - Otherwise determine it yourself by looking into the code. Plugins that intercept a lot of
          callbacks to achieve fancy functionality (like a cup plugin or similar) are usually not
          scalable.
