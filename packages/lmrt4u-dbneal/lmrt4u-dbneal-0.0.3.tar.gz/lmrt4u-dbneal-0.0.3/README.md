## Installation
To install the tool without the use of  the code repository

```
pip install lmrt4u-dbneal
```

## Usage

To run the tool do

```
python -m lmrt4u
```

This generates a sample Lmrt4ufile in current directory. File can be modified manually then re-run to display updated sprint information.

To run the tool without leveraging to user interface you can pass arguments directly

```
python -m lmrt4u Burndown Chart
```

### Lmrt4uFile

The Lmrt4uFile contains the backlog information that will be used when the burndown charts are generated. Please note that all sprint properties are enforced through a verification module
so make sure to follow the configuration guide below.

Here's a brief example  of the file (All information in parenthesis is for the user and should NOT be included in the file):

```
sprints: (List of sprints contained in the backlog, sample file contains one but you can include as many as you'd like)
  Sample Sprint: (This is the name of a sprint)
    active: true (A boolean property, if a sprint is active (True) then a burndown chart will be generated)
    end: '2019-04-16' (End date for the sprint, *must occur after the start date*, *must match format 'yyyy-MM-DD'*)
    start: '2019-04-02' (Start date for the sprint, *must match format 'yyyy-MM-DD'))
    stories: (List of arguments with each unique item representing a story)
    - - Story Name 1 (This is the name of a story in the sprint)
      - This is the description (This is the description for the story)
      - 10 (This is the amount of story points assigned to the story)
      - '2019-04-03' (This is the completion date, put null if the story is yet to be completed)
```

## Requirements

Package requirements are handled using pip. To install them do
