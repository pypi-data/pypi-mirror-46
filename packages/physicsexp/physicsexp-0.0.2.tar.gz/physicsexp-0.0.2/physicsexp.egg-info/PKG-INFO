Description: # PhysicsExp
        ### USTC Physics Experiments Data Processing Tools
        
        ### 中科大大物实验数据处理工具
        
        #### Comes with NO WARRENTY
        
        The package is also released on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/physicsexp/).
        
        This README is shown in both pypi package and github repo, but is designed for github only. 
        
        For readers from pypi, [here](https://github.com/ustcpetergu/PhysicsExp) please. 
        
        - The github repo(ustcpetergu/PhysicsExp) includes: physicsexp python package(directory `physicsexp`), my experiment data(in directory `Experiments`, archived by semester), some misc files and automation scripts. 
        
        - The pypi package(physicsexp) only includes the main python package, but that's enough and easy to use. 
        
        最终目的是建造一套用于自动化处理大物实验数据、绘制图像、生成可打印文档、将文档提交到在线打印系统的工具；针对常用数据处理需求实现简化和自动化，只要简单的几行代码，就能完成通用的绘图、拟合、不确定度计算等大物实验常用任务。
        理想与现实差距还很大，目前仅仅包装了一些matplotlib绘图库和文件输入简化重复劳动。
        
        ### A Simple Guide
        
        #### The easy way 
        
        Create a virtualenv(here named test-env)
        
        ```
        python -m venv test-env
        ```
        
        Activate it
        
        ```
        ./test-env/Scripts/activate.bat
        ```
        
        Install the package from pypi, (optional) use mirror to accelerate
        
        ```
        pip install -i https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple physicsexp
        ```
        
        Run the scripts you downloaded from github in the virtualenv
        
        ```
        python path/to/plot.py
        ```
        
        You'll see graphs poped out and saved to .png, a generated gen.docx ready to print, and calculations(if any) printed to output. Then you can modify the code or write your own code to process data!
        
        #### For advanced users 
        
        Assuming you are using Windows.
        
        **Change the command to make then work on your device! Don't just copy & paste!**
        
         **Prepare to build**
        
        Set up environment to build and release python packages, detailed guide can be found on pypi website. 
        
        **Build**
        
        ```
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        Then the packaged wheel file can be found at `./dist/physicsexp-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl`(Name may be different)
        
        **Install**
        
        **This package haven't been tested as it should and I don't know what will happen after installation.**
        
        **So use a virtualenv is recommended. **
        
        Create a virtualenv(here named test-env)
        
        ```
        python -m venv test-env
        ```
        
        Activate it
        
        ```
        ./test-env/Scripts/activate.bat
        ```
        
        Install the wheel (Use USTC mirror to accelerate, and it will download and install other required packages)
        
        ```
        pip install -i https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple path\to\physicsexp-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        
        Wait a moment for the installation to finish.
        
        **Use**
        
        Launch python in your venv
        
        ```
        python
        ```
        
        Import the package (`from xxx import *` may be bad, don't imitate me)
        
        ```
        >>> from physicsexp.mainfunc import *
        >>> from physicsexp.gendocx import *
        >>>
        ```
        
        Enjoy. 
        
        ### Usage
        
        Wanna know how to use? Read the source code yourself, see templates at `physicsexp/Template/` and examples at `Experiments/`(Most of them are already outdated and cannot be run, if you really need to run them, maybe a `git reset` is the last way) , or contact developer.
        
        But most of the time neither of these works. 
        
        **And can using these tools boost your efficiency? I don't know, but probably can't. **
        
        **Finally, think twice before wasting time on this project, instead, enjoy your life, learn some real physics, and find a (boy|girl)friend. **
