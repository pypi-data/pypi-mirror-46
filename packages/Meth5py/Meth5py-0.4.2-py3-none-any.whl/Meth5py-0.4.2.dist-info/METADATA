Meth5py
==========

This will parse output from

* [BSMAP's](https://sites.google.com/a/brown.edu/bioinformatics-in-biomed/bsmap-for-methylation) methratio.py
* [BSMAPz's](https://github.com/zyndagj/BSMAPz) methratio.py

and make a sparse, compressed hdf5 representation for fast queries based on position.
Indexing is 1-based and follows the same conventions as samtools's faidx.
