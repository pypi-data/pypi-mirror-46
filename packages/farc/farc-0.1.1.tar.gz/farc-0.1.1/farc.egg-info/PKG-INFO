Description: # farc
        
        Framework for Asyncio/Actor/AHSM Run-to-completion Concurrency
        written in Python3.  In other words, a cheap knock-off of
        [QP](www.state-machine.com) that uses Python3 coroutines.
        [This book](https://newcontinuum.dl.sourceforge.net/project/qpc/doc/PSiCC2.pdf)
        describes QP and how to program hierarchical state machines.
        
        This framework has fewer than 1000 LOC.  It allows the programmer to create
        highly-concurrent programs by using a "message-passing" system and
        run-to-completion message handlers within a state-machine architecture.
        With these tools, complex, asynchronous operations are decomposed
        into managable chunks of code.
        
        In the paragraph above message-passing is in quotes because farc is doing
        object reference copy and not object copy or serialization.
        This leaves the programmer open to nasty side-effects.
        For example, if you pass a list object and the recipient modifies the list,
        the sender experiences those modifications even after the message was passed.
        
        Known Issue: On windows, Ctrl+C is supressed by asyncio event loop's
        run_forever() ([bug report](https://bugs.python.org/issue23057)).
        The workaround is to inject an event to awake the event loop.
        
        Note:  This project used to be called "pq" but that name was taken in PyPI,
        so I renamed to farc (ugh).

        ## Release History
        
        2019/05/15  0.1.1
        - Removed 'initialState' argument from farc.Hsm() constructor;
          framework now expects Hsm/Ahsm classes to have 'initial()' method.
        - Made state methods private in examples to demonstrate a best-practice.
        - Created farc.Framework.run_forever() helper function.
        - Misc comment and doctring improvements
