    "about": "I have worked at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute for two years. I started as a Summer Scholar and completed a software testing project using the idea of Metamorphic Testing. I discovered some interesting results and had my first paper submitted and published to an international conference. I then developed an RNA-Seq analysis pipeline based on the results in my software testing project, which aims to lower the number of false negative results in the alignment process. After that, I implemented a tool that utilises cloud computing and machine learning to perform data mining and processing.\n\nI have also worked as a Software Engineer at Timeweave to develop and maintain scripts that were used at the backend of the app. And I have worked as a Teaching Assistant at Code Camp. And lastly, I have spent some time developing bots on the messaging platform Telegram.",
