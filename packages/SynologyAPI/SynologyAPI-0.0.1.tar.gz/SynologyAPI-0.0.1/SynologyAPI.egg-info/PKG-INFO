        ## Setup
        
        To run the Compyler it must be installed. It can be installed either from pypi or from the source code of the directory.
        
        ### From Source
        
        Either in a Python Virtual Environment or just on your machine in the root of the directory run `make install` this will install the SynologyAPI from the source code in the repo using the setup.py file. If you would like to uninstall simply run `make uninstall`
        
        ## Usage
        
        There are hundrends of API endpoints for the actual Synology web API, for my purposes I only need the ability to upload. However this API wrapper can be expanded in the future to support futher features. The Offical [Synology API Documentation](https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/DeveloperGuide/Synology_Download_Station_Web_API.pdf) is underwhelming and is very difficult to implement, this is why this wrapper is needed.
        
        Once installed use the following syntax to upload a file
        
        `SynologyAPI <username> <password> <ip or domain of share drive> <file_source_path> <file_target_path>`
