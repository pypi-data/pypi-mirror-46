===================
ckanext-downloadall
===================

This CKAN extension adds a "Download all" button to datasets. This downloads
a zip file containing all the resource files and a datapackage.json.

.. image:: demo.png

The datapackage.json is a [Frictionless Data] standard, also known as a Data
Package.

If the resource is pushed/xloaded to Datastore then the schema (column types)
are included in the datapackage.json file.

This extension uses a CKAN background job to create the zip every time a
dataset is created or updated. This suits CKANs where all files are uploaded -
if the underlying data file changes without CKAN knowing about it, then the zip
will not include the update.

(This extension is inspired by
[ckanext-packagezip](https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-packagezip), but that
is old and relied on ckanext-archiver and IPipe.)

------------
Requirements

3. Add ``downloadall`` to the ``ckan.plugins`` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   ``/etc/ckan/default/production.ini``).

4. Restart CKAN. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on Ubuntu::

     sudo service apache2 reload

Ensure the background job 'worker' process is running - see
https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/background-tasks.html#running-background-jobs
