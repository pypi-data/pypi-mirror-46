"""
This is a git commit-hook which can be used to check if huge files
 where accidentally added to the staging area and are about to be
 committed.
If there is a file which is bigger then the given "max_file_size"-
 variable, the script will exit non-zero and abort the commit.
This script is meant to be added as a "pre-commit"-hook. See this
 page for further information:
    http://progit.org/book/ch7-3.html#installing_a_hook
In order to make the script work probably, you'll need to set the
 above path to the python interpreter (first line of the file)
 according to your system (under *NIX do "which python" to find out).
Also, the "git_binary_path"-variable should contain the absolute
 path to your "git"-executable (you can use "which" here, too).
See the included README-file for further information.
The script was developed and has been confirmed to work under
 python 3.2.2 and git 1.7.7.1 (might also work with earlier versions!)
