Control Sonoff devices running original firmware, in LAN mode.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module provides a way to interface with Sonoff smart home devices,
such as smart switches (e.g. Sonoff Basic), plugs (e.g. Sonoff S20),
and wall switches (e.g. Sonoff Touch), when these devices are in LAN Mode.

LAN Mode is a feature introduced by manufacturer Itead, to allow operation
locally when their servers are unavailable.
Further details can be found in the `eWeLink LAN Mode guide`__.

__ https://help.ewelink.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360007134171-LAN-Mode-Tutorial

Since mid 2018, the firmware Itead have shipped with most Sonoff devices
has provided this feature, allowing devices to be controlled directly
on the local network using a WebSocket connection on port 8081.

The feature is designed to only be used when there is no connection
to the Itead cloud servers, (e.g. if your internet connection is down,
or their servers are down).
As such, it is only enabled when the device is connected to your WiFi
network, but *unable to reach the Itead servers*.

Most users will only be able to use this by **deliberately
blocking internet access** to their Sonoff devices.

Features
--------

* Discover all devices on local network (192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24)
* Discover IP address for device with known Device ID (from eWeLink app)
* Read device state
* Switch device ON/OFF
* Listen for state changes announced by the device (e.g. by physical switch)
* Activate inching/momentary device, with variable ON time (e.g. 1s)

Usage Example
=======================
::

    $ pysonofflan discover
    2019-01-31 00:45:32,074 - info: Attempting to discover Sonoff LAN Mode devices on the local network, please wait...
    2019-01-31 00:46:24,007 - info: Found Sonoff LAN Mode device at IP 192.168.0.77

    $ pysonofflan --host 192.168.0.77 state

    $ pysonofflan --host 192.168.0.77 on

    2019-01-31 00:49:40,508 - info: == Device: 10006866e9 (192.168.0.77) ==
    2019-01-31 00:49:40,508 - info: State: OFF
    2019-01-31 00:49:40,508 - info:
    2019-01-31 00:49:40,508 - info: New state:
    2019-01-31 00:49:40,508 - info: == Device: 10006866e9 (192.168.0.77) ==
    2019-01-31 00:49:40,508 - info: State: ON

Library Usage
------------------

All common, shared functionality is available through :code:`SonoffSwitch` class::

    x = SonoffSwitch("192.168.1.50")

Upon instantiating the SonoffSwitch class, a connection is
initiated and device state is populated, but no further action is taken.

For most use cases, you'll want to make use of the :code:`callback_after_update`
parameter to do something with the device after a connection has been
initialised, for example::

    async def print_state_callback(device):
        if device.basic_info is not None:
            print("ON" if device.is_on else "OFF")
            device.shutdown_event_loop()

    SonoffSwitch(
        host="192.168.1.50",
        callback_after_update=print_state_callback
    )

This example simply connects to the device, prints whether it is currently
"ON" or "OFF", then closes the connection. Note, the callback must be
asynchronous.

Module-specific errors are raised as Exceptions, and are expected
to be handled by the user of the library.
