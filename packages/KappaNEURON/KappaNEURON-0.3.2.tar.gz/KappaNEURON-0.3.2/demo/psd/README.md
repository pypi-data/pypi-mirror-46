Model of Ca-CaM-CaMKII pathways in PSD
======================================

This should approximately recreate Fig 6. of
[Sterratt & al (2015)][1]. Because it is a stochastic model, and the
random seed is not set, the figure will not look exactly the same.
```
python simple-psd-pepke-kappa-nmda.py
python -i simple-psd-pepke-kappa-nmda-plot.py
```

The kappa file is `simple-psd-pepke-kappa-nmda.ka`.

TODO: add more information here.
