# Simple calcium pump with NMDA syanpse

# Declaration of internal calcium; the name needs to be 'ca' to match
# up with calcium in NEURON
%agent: ca(x)
%agent: glu(b)


# Rules
'ca extrusion' ca(x)  ->  @ 5
# Clear glu quickly from the cleft wihtin about 100uS
'glu clearance'    glu(b) ->  @ 10 

# Initialise. This line will be overridden by NEURON, but is useful if
# running as a stand-alone Kappa file
%init: 1 ca(x)
%init: 1 glu(b)

# An observation. This line is not needed by NEURON but is useful if
# running as a stand-alone Kappa file
# %obs: 'ca' ca(x)
