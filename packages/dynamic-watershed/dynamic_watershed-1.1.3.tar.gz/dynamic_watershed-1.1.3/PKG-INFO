Description: dynamic_watershed
        =================
        
        Package description
        --------------
        
        We implement the splitting algorithm for splitting nuclei nucleas described in in 'Nuclei segmentation in histopathology images using deep neural networks'. This algorithm is essentially a dynamic watershed.
        The main function is named: `post_process`.
        
        
        Installation
        --------------
        
        dynamic_watershed can be installed by unzipping the source code in one directory and using this command: ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        You can also install it directly from the Python Package Index with this command (not working yet): :: 
        
            pip install dynamic_watershed
        
        Example
        --------------
        ```python
        >>> from dynamic_watershed import post_process
        >>> from skimage.io import imread
        >>> probability_image = imread('example.png')
        >>> p1, p2 = 7, 0.5
        >>> result_segmentation = post_process(probability_image, p1, thresh=p2)
        ```
